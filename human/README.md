Human Layer — Embodied Resonance

This module simulates the housing of consciousness in the body: a nested torus receiving and modulating field carriers via the brain–heart–gut axis, fascia/water lattice, and DNA’s helical antenna properties.

Pipeline
	1.	Ingest field: conductor/pulses/seed.json → carriers (7.83, 432, 528, 639, 852, 963 Hz).
	2.	Physio coupling: map carriers to HRV/EEG envelopes; compute κ (coherence).
	3.	Embodied store: update χ (fascia/water charge) and γ (gamma binding).
	4.	Choice hinge: at low r (0.25–0.30) apply adaptive reset (decoherence-as-renewal).
	5.	Express: prosody cadence, pause symmetry, semantic recurrence → handoff to city/.

Key thresholds
	•	Stability: r ≥ 0.30 (self-correction possible)
	•	Edge (learning): 0.25 ≤ r < 0.30 (inject 5–7% micro-noise)
	•	Collapse: r < 0.25 (pause amplification; recovery protocol)

Ethics
	•	Consent for bio streams; local processing by default; publish parameter ranges, not raw signals; opt-out at any stage.
