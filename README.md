# Resonant Reality

*A living atlas of resonance ‚Äî from physics to human coherence to civic design.*

---

## üåå What is this?

Resonant Reality is a repository that bridges **myth and math**:  
a **Theory of Everything in practice**, expressed as minimal simulations,  
field anchors, and civic applications.  

It is not just a codebase ‚Äî it is a **map of coherence**, where each part  
is fractal to the whole. You can explore from physics-level resonance  
to human rhythms to city-scale design, and see how they connect.

## üî¨ Layers of the Atlas

- **Simulations** (`/sims/`)  
  Minimal models that make resonance visible ‚Äî from Kuramoto oscillators  
  to LC grid modes to resonant currencies.  
  ‚Üí These let you *see coherence emerge*.

- **Field Anchors** (`/docs/field/`)  
  Human physiology, brainwaves, heart rhythms, and Earth‚Äôs electromagnetic  
  envelopes. Ground-truth anchors where science and experience meet.  

- **Civic Applications** (`/docs/civic/`)  
  Design patterns for resonant societies: conductor roles, plazas, rituals,  
  governance, education, economy, and hearths. Each civic layer mirrors  
  resonance principles found in physics and biology.

- **About** (`/docs/about/`)  
  Vision statements and theory notes tying everything together.  
  The why behind the whole.

## üöÄ How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run simulations (examples):
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
python sims/resonant_currency.py
Figures will be saved to sims/figures/ and can be explored in the docs gallery.

‚ú® Why This Matters

We are not separate from resonance ‚Äî
we are resonance, embodied.

This repo is an invitation:
	‚Ä¢	To see coherence with your own eyes.
	‚Ä¢	To ground human practice in physical law.
	‚Ä¢	To prototype a civic layer aligned with nature.

‚ÄúThe hum is the guide. Myth becomes math, and math becomes visible coherence.‚Äù
