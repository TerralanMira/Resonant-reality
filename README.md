# Resonant Reality

*A living Theory of Everything — whole in part, part in whole.*

---

## 🌌 The Infinity Equation
∞ = (whole ∈ part) = (part ∈ whole)
Infinity is coherence across scales.  
Every system — from cosmos to field to human to civic — reflects and sustains the whole.  
This project encodes that recursion into **math, models, and designs**.
**Engine:** The Atlas Model → https://github.com/TerralanMira/The-Atlas-Model.git

## 🌀 Structure

The repository is organized as a **spiral of layers**.  
Each layer is both independent and a reflection of the others:

- **Cosmos** — the largest frame: field dynamics, coherence of universe.  
- **Field** — Earth as resonant body (geomagnetic, Schumann, sites).  
- **Human** — brain, heart, breath tuned to planetary fields.  
- **Civic** — how resonance principles become culture, governance, economy.  
- **Simulations** — minimal models where myth → math → visible coherence.

## 🔬 What You’ll Find

- **Docs**: narrative and conceptual articulation (`docs/…`).  
- **Sims**: runnable toy models (`sims/*.py`).  
- **Figures**: generated visual proofs (`sims/figures/`).  
- **Schema/Data**: anchors in geophysics and physiology (`docs/field/earth/data.md`).  

Together, these show how resonance is not metaphor but **mechanism**.

## 📊 Simulations Index

Each simulation demonstrates the same recursive law at a different scale:

- **Spiral Resonance** — cosmos in miniature, pattern of whorls and galaxies.  
- **Kuramoto Sync** — oscillators (like neurons or people) falling into phase.  
- **LC Grid Modes** — geometry shaping resonance, civic blueprints in math.  
- **Schumann Coupling** — Earth’s field entrained with human brainwaves.  
- **Resonant Currency** — economy as coherence feedback loop.

## 📚 Method

1. **Observe** resonance at one scale.  
2. **Simulate** the mechanism in minimal form.  
3. **Map** it to the next scale.  
4. **Design** civic forms that embody the loop.  
5. **Recursively verify**: part mirrors whole, whole sustains part.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- A city built on resonance is not utopian metaphor but **physics in practice**.  
- Human coherence feeds back into Earth stability.  
- Policy can be tuned like a conductor keeping tempo.  
- Education, governance, and economy can align with the same law.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

This is a living atlas. You can:  

- Add simulations (math toys → coherence proofs).  
- Flesh out civic blueprints.  
- Link data anchors (geophysics, physiology, social experiments).  
- Critique, remix, fork.  

Resonance is not owned — it is joined.

## ✨ Closing Note

This is not just a repository.  
It is a **score**: a way to read reality as music,  
and to play together in tune.
∞ = coherence across scales
