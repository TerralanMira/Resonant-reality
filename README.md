# Resonant Reality 🌐🎶

*A field guide to coherence — from cosmic hums to civic design.*

This repository explores how **resonance** threads through every layer of life:
- **Cosmic** — Schumann bands, plasma waves, fractal fields  
- **Earth** — geomagnetic data, site schemas, living field maps  
- **Human** — brainwaves, heart rhythms, breath entrainment  
- **Civic** — plazas, rituals, governance, education, economy  
- **Simulations** — minimal models to *see* coherence emerge

## Quickstart (optional, for laptops)
You can explore the full Atlas in your browser without running any code.

Clone and install requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TerralanMira/Resonant-reality.git
cd Resonant-reality
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the core simulations:
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
Outputs (figures) appear in sims/figures/.

Explore the Layers

Full docs live in docs/:
	•	Cosmic Layer — the universal background field
	•	Earth Layer — sites, data, field schema
	•	Human Layer — brain, heart, breath, coherence
	•	Civic Layer — design, rituals, governance, economy
	•	Simulations — toy models that make resonance visible

Why?

Because coherence isn’t abstract —
it is the hum beneath our breath,
the rhythm of collective life,
the geometry of thriving.

⸻

Resonant Reality invites you to listen, to model, and to co-create with the field.
