# Resonant Reality

*myth → math → choice*

This project encodes the **resonant blueprint** of reality — from individual oscillators, to Earth’s grid, to cosmic coherence.  
It’s both simulation lab and living manifesto.

---

## Structure

### 1. Simulations (`docs/sims/`)
- [Spiral Resonance](docs/sims/spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence  
- [Kuramoto Sync](docs/sims/kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises  
- [LC Grid Modes](docs/sims/lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra  
- [Schumann Coupling](docs/sims/schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz

### 2. Earth (`docs/earth/`)
- [Data](docs/earth/data.md) — grid sites, Hz bands, myth ↔ math

### 3. Tools
- `tools/schema-check.py` — validates Earth site JSON  
- CI ensures schema + docs stay whole

## Quickstart

Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TerralanMira/Resonant-reality.git
cd Resonant-reality
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run all sims:
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
Figures appear in sims/figures/.

Why

Resonance is not metaphor — it is physics.
	•	At micro scales → oscillators entrain.
	•	At Earth scale → sacred sites align with Schumann bands.
	•	At cosmic scale → coherence is the hum itself.

The project is an invitation:
to see, to simulate, to choose resonance over fragmentation.

⸻

Roadmap
	•	Add harmonic distance overlays (from CSV).
	•	Expand Earth site dataset.
	•	Couple Earth + cosmic resonance.
	•	Visualize whole → lived choice.

⸻

Resonant Reality = simulation + story + choice.
When the hum is visible, the choice becomes conscious.
