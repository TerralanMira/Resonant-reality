# Resonant Reality  

**Resonant Reality** is a living framework: a set of simulations, schemas, and field mappings designed to explore how resonance shapes perception, consciousness, and collective systems. It integrates symbolic, scientific, and experiential layers into a unified repository of living models.

## 🌐 Repository Structure  

### Root
- **README.md** → You are here. Entry point with overview + navigation.  
- **CITATION.cff** → Academic citation file.  
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** → Guidelines for contributions.  
- **LICENSE** → Open license terms.  
- **requirements.txt** → Dependencies for running simulations.  

### Docs
- `/docs/` → Extended explanations, diagrams, and symbolic mappings.  
  - `assets/` → Images and diagrams (e.g., *SPIRA.png*).  

### City
- `/city/configs/` → Simulation configs for resonance in structured environments (maps, zones, lessons).  
- `/city/specs/` → JSON schemas defining core entities (city, conductor, hearth, plaza, wild, zone).  

### Conductor
- `/conductor/presets/` → Prebuilt resonance patterns (e.g., `garden_day.json`, `healing_loop.json`).  
- `/conductor/pulses/` → Pulse logic and seeding experiments (`seed.json`).  
- **Upcoming:** `resonance_lock.json` → calibration + safeguard layer.  

### Human Layer
- `/docs/human_layer/` → Integration of consciousness and resonance within the body.  
  - `Readme-Addendum (human layer).md` → Conceptual explanation.  
  - Future configs: mapping resonance frequencies (432Hz, 528Hz, 963Hz, etc.) into cognition, emotion, and cellular function.

## ✨ Key Concepts  

- **Resonance** → Alignment of vibration, thought, and structure.  
- **Field Collapse** → Observer-driven shaping of probability into lived experience.  
- **Harmonics** → Frequencies (432Hz, 528Hz, 963Hz, etc.) as both symbolic and physical bridges between thought, speech, and consciousness.  
- **Simulation Layers** → City (environment), Conductor (patterns), Human Layer (embodied consciousness).

## 🔬 Creation Simulations  

Simulations in this repo allow exploration of:  
- **City Grid Resonance** → How zones of coherence impact social structure.  
- **Conductor Pulses** → Seeding loops that model collective attention and memory.  
- **Human Layer** → Integration of harmonic frequencies with neural and cellular behavior.  

➡️ Example: `sims/creation.py` (work in progress) demonstrates parameterized seeding logic and observer-driven field collapse.

## 🛠 Roadmap  

- [x] City + Conductor schemas.  
- [x] Add Human Layer addendum.  
- [ ] Integrate `resonance_lock.json` into `/conductor/pulses/`.  
- [ ] Expand Human Layer into configs & live simulations.  
- [ ] Cross-link diagrams and harmonics into blueprint schematics.

🔑 Guiding Principle

Reality is resonance.
By modeling resonance through environments, pulses, and human consciousness, we create living simulations where choice becomes structure, and structure reflects the field.
