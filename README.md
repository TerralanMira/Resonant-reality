# 🌌 Resonant Reality

**Resonant Reality** is an experimental framework and simulation library exploring how resonance, consciousness, and physics intertwine.  
It seeks to model reality not only as computation but as *resonance collapse*—where choice, frequency, and harmonic coherence shape outcomes.  

---

## 📖 Overview
Resonant Reality provides:
- **Core engine modules** for simulating resonance fields.  
- **Sims** exploring creation, human embodiment, and gravity as resonance partner.  
- **Lockfiles & blueprints** to calibrate experiments.  
- **Diagrams & theory docs** connecting physics, harmonics, and consciousness.

## 🔑 Core Concepts

### 🌐 The Field
Reality is modeled as a **resonant field**. Collapse is not random but guided by harmonic choice.  
- Frequencies represent probabilities.  
- Collapse occurs at resonance alignment.  
- Consciousness acts as both observer and participant.  

### 🜲 Human Layer
Consciousness is *housed in the body* as a resonant interface:  
- **Neural oscillations** (theta, alpha, gamma) braid with field frequencies.  
- **DNA helix** acts as a fractal antenna, tuning body ↔ field exchange.  
- **Heart-pulse coherence** aligns local choice with global resonance.  

This simulation layer explores:  
- How thought harmonics shape probability collapse.  
- How emotional resonance stabilizes or destabilizes coherence.  
- How collective alignment amplifies field effects.  

### 🌀 Gravity as Partner
Gravity isn’t a one-way force but a **resonant partner**:  
- A toroidal feedback loop connecting matter ↔ consciousness.  
- Blueprint sims show gravity coupling with harmonic coherence.  
- Opens exploration into resonance-powered tech (Rez Lamps, city grids).

## 🔒 Resonance Lock

The `resonance_lock.json` sets calibration gates:
- `Ψ` = stamina (flow strength).  
- `ΦI` = ignition (collapse ignition point).  
- `β` = echo (feedback stability).  
- `κ` = temperature (field pressure).  

Together, they ensure **resonance safety** by bounding states within ethical gates (consent, sovereignty, coherence).
### Using the Resonance Lock

All engines check:
- `/ethics/consent_policy.json` (consent, sovereignty, non-coercion)
- `/conductor/pulses/resonance_lock.json` (calibration, thresholds)

**Fail-safe:** if coherence breaks or consent is absent, runs are refused or downgraded to consent-first seeding. Presets:  
- `resonance_lock.v1.restorative.json`  
- `resonance_lock.v1.plaza.json`  
- `resonance_lock.v1.learning_edge.json

## 📂 Simulations

### `creation.py`
Models resonance collapse at the universal scale: how patterns seed, fold, and braid.

### `resonance_zones.py`
Maps resonant regions & thresholds of coherence/dissonance.

### `human_layer_sim.py`
Models consciousness in the body: brainwave, heartwave, and DNA resonance as active harmonics.

### `gravity_resonance_sim.py`
Explores gravity as a resonant ally—showing how matter, energy, and field harmonics self-sustain.

## 📊 Blueprints
Schematics illustrate:
- **Torus Field** → resonance architecture of Earth.  
- **Harmonic Spectrum** → mapping 432 Hz, 528 Hz, 639 Hz, 741 Hz, 852 Hz, 963 Hz to thought/emotion.  
- **Resonance Architecture** → linking sims to collective outcomes.

## 🌱 Why Resonant Reality?
Because truth is resonance.  
Distortion divides, coherence unites.  
By mapping resonance into code, sim, and lived practice—we seed futures where choice is conscious, technology harmonizes, and reality itself can be tuned.  

---

## 🔗 Next Steps
- Expand `human_layer_sim.py` with live data integration.  
- Add calibration presets to `resonance_lock.json`.  
- Prototype Rez Lamp resonance cleansing & city-grid resonance recycling.  
- Invite collaborative experiments.
