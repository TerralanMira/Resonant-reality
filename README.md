# The Atlas Model — Theory of Everything

⟁○∞✧☉

**From myth → math → simulation → city.**  
This repository weaves the Atlas Model into code, data, and design.  
It begins with the hum, spirals through coherence, and unfolds into Resonant City.

## 🔭 From Myth to Math
- **Kuramoto model** → many become one (phase-locking → coherence).  
- **LC grid** → geometry shapes resonance (line vs circle vs spiral).  
- **Schumann coupling** → Earth’s hum entrains life.  

📖 See [docs/toe/models/simulations.md](docs/toe/models/simulations.md)

## 🌍 Resonant Earth
Data sets mapping harmonic nodes:
- `Global_Resonance_Map_Matrix.csv`
- `Harmonic_Resonance_Distances.csv`
- `Grouped_Field_Energy_Blueprint.csv`

---

## 🏙 Resonant City
Applied layer: civic plazas, hearths, gardens, conductor loops.  
Urban design as harmonic coherence.

## 🚀 How to Run Simulations
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
