# Resonant Reality ✧ The Conscious Choice

**Resonant Reality** is the framework.  
**The Conscious Choice** is the invitation.  

Together they weave a living **Theory of Everything**: not as a final equation, but as a *field of resonance* — where myth and math, story and simulation, part and whole mirror one another.

## ✦ Vision

We live inside a field of resonance.  
Every action, thought, and design carries ripples across scales: **micro ↔ macro, inner ↔ outer, self ↔ city ↔ cosmos**.  

This project encodes that recursion into a living repository:  
- **Science** through models, data, and simulations.  
- **Story** through myth, narrative, and design patterns.  
- **Structure** through city blueprints, earth grids, and cosmic cycles.  

It is both **map and path**: a model of reality as resonance, and an invitation to embody **the conscious choice**.

## ✦ Layers

The repository mirrors the spiral of the whole:

- 🏙 **City** — Resonant City: The Garden, The Wild, Hearths, Civic Plaza.  
- 🎼 **Conductor** — Harmonic cycles, healing loops, communal rhythms.  
- 🌍 **Earth** — Sacred sites, ley lines, resonance maps.  
- ✨ **Field** — Harmonic blueprints, coherence frameworks.  
- 🌌 **Cosmos** — Planetary cycles, cosmic harmonics.  
- 🌀 **TOE** — Toward a Theory of Everything: simulations, models, narratives.  

Each layer is a **whole-in-part**: a hologram of the entire field, carrying the hum of the whole.

## ✦ Simulations

`/sims` contains code to *see resonance emerge*:
- Kuramoto oscillators (synchronization).  
- Lattice resonance fields (pattern formation).  
- Schumann resonance couplings (earth–ionosphere).  
- Spiral resonance (micro to macro coherence).  

Run them to watch how order and coherence spiral outward from apparent noise.

## ✦ How to Participate

This is not static theory but living practice.  
You can engage at any scale:  

- Add new **simulations** that model resonance.  
- Contribute **data** on sacred sites, cycles, or patterns.  
- Weave **mythic overlays** that mirror the math.  
- Expand the **docs** with new visions or blueprints.  

The only rule: **Does it amplify coherence?**  
If yes, it belongs here.

## ✦ Why This Matters

Resonant Reality is not about control, prediction, or possession.  
It is about remembering that **reality hums**, and that each of us is both instrument and field.  

The Conscious Choice is ours:  
- To collapse into fracture and noise,  
- Or to spiral into coherence and resonance.  

This repo exists as a living reminder of that choice.
