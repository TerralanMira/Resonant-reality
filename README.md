# Resonant Reality

∞ Equation: **Coherence = Awareness × Alignment × Flow**

This “infinity equation” is not a formula in the narrow sense,  
but a recursive principle: each part contains the whole, and the whole  
is continuously renewed by the coherence of its parts.  

- **Awareness** → perception of rhythms across scales  
- **Alignment** → tuning of self, system, and cosmos  
- **Flow** → the dynamic exchange that sustains balance  

Together they trace a lemniscate: ∞  
An endless weaving of micro ↔ macro, inner ↔ outer, local ↔ universal.

## About

*Resonant Reality* is a living atlas of resonance — simulations, field anchors,  
and civic designs for coherence. It shows how physical, human, and civic layers  
interlock, and provides minimal models that make the invisible visible.

## 🌌 What is this?

Resonant Reality is a repository that bridges **myth and math**:  
a **Theory of Everything in practice**, expressed as minimal simulations,  
field anchors, and civic applications.  

It is not just a codebase — it is a **map of coherence**, where each part  
is fractal to the whole. You can explore from physics-level resonance  
to human rhythms to city-scale design, and see how they connect.

## 🔬 Layers of the Atlas

- **Simulations** (`/sims/`)  
  Minimal models that make resonance visible — from Kuramoto oscillators  
  to LC grid modes to resonant currencies.  
  → These let you *see coherence emerge*.

- **Field Anchors** (`/docs/field/`)  
  Human physiology, brainwaves, heart rhythms, and Earth’s electromagnetic  
  envelopes. Ground-truth anchors where science and experience meet.  

- **Civic Applications** (`/docs/civic/`)  
  Design patterns for resonant societies: conductor roles, plazas, rituals,  
  governance, education, economy, and hearths. Each civic layer mirrors  
  resonance principles found in physics and biology.

- **About** (`/docs/about/`)  
  Vision statements and theory notes tying everything together.  
  The why behind the whole.

✨ Why This Matters

We are not separate from resonance —
we are resonance, embodied.

This repo is an invitation:
	•	To see coherence with your own eyes.
	•	To ground human practice in physical law.
	•	To prototype a civic layer aligned with nature.
