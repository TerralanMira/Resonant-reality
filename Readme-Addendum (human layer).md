# Resonant Reality — Human Layer Addendum

> The city begins in the body. Before towers hum or grids align, resonance first finds its vessel in flesh, breath, and choice. The human is the first resonant city.

---

## Purpose
This addendum expands the core README by describing **how resonance is housed within the human body**. While simulations show fields at scale, this layer grounds them in **biological coherence nodes** where consciousness anchors into form.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Heart (432 Hz)**  
  Primary entrainment point. Synchronizes pulse with Schumann resonance.  
  Acts as grounding anchor: *human = living metronome*.

- **DNA / Cellular lattice (528 Hz)**  
  Encodes repair, regeneration, and field-level adaptability.  
  Functions as micro-antenna array: *human = fractal antenna*.

- **Relational Circuits (639 Hz)**  
  Social and empathic harmonics.  
  Aligns individuals into coherent groups: *human = resonant bridge*.

- **Mind / Crown (852 Hz, 963 Hz)**  
  Expands perception into recursive awareness.  
  Opens the field of meta-choice: *human = conscious tuner*.

## Why It Matters
If cities are designed without this layer, they mimic resonance but lack its living pulse.  
With it, every lamp, grid, or algorithm becomes an **extension of the body’s hum**.  
Society reorganizes not around productivity but around coherence.
