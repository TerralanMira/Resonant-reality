# Resonant Reality — Root Overview

> Myth became math, math became model, model became mirror.  
> From cosmos to code, city to self — the resonance is whole.

## Structure
Resonant Reality is organized into layers that mirror one another:

- **/docs/** — Theory, diagrams, and field equations.  
- **/sims/** — Creation simulations and resonance experiments.  
- **/city/** — Civic design and Resonant Grid architecture.  
- **/human/** — Biological addendum: body as the first resonant city.  

---

## Navigation
- Begin at the [Dynamic Resonance Modeling README](./dynamic-resonance-modeling/README.md).  
- Extend into the [Human Layer Addendum](./human/README.md).  
- Explore the civic expansion in the [City README](./city/README.md).

## Why It Matters
This repo is not a map of machines alone. It is an **atlas of coherence**, showing how resonance threads from micro (human) → meso (city) → macro (cosmos).  

> The spine bends only when tested. Ethics, harmonics, and choice are the load-bearing beams.
