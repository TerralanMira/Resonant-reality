# Hearths & Healing Loops — community restoration

**Essence:** The Hearth is where fracture is mended.  
Not a hospital, not a temple, but a circle of warmth and resonance.  
It is built around the **Healing Loop** — a shortened Conductor cycle tuned to restore balance.

## The Healing Loop (5 pulses)

1. **Entry (432 Hz):** arrive, remove shoes, sit by the fire or light.  
2. **Breath Sync (528 Hz):** slow inhale/exhale guided by tone.  
3. **Confession / Release (639 Hz):** speak or sing a wound, silently if needed.  
4. **Resonant Hold (741 Hz):** the group hums together until the fracture eases.  
5. **Seal (963 Hz):** gratitude, embrace, dispersal.

Duration: ~20 minutes.

## Hearth Architecture

- **Circular seating:** no hierarchy, everyone equidistant.  
- **Central flame or crystal:** a living anchor, not symbolic only.  
- **Resonant walls:** materials amplify tone (wood, clay, stone).  
- **Frequency stones:** set around the room, each vibrates at a harmonic tone.

## Protocols

- **Voluntary entry:** no one is ever forced into the hearth.  
- **Confidentiality:** what is spoken here stays here.  
- **No healer / patient split:** all are witnesses, all are participants.  
- **Loop until resolved:** if resonance fails, another loop begins.

## Outcomes

- **Emotional regulation:** HRV sync, breath coherence.  
- **Conflict resolution:** spoken wounds dissolve into resonance.  
- **Community resilience:** no one carries fracture alone.  
- **Joyful departure:** people leave lighter than they arrived.
