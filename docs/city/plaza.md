# The Civic Plaza — governance by coherence

**Essence:** The Plaza is where the city decides — not by debate or dominance, but by resonance. Decision is coherence, not conquest.

## Daily flow (plaza circle)
- **Entry (432 Hz):** everyone gathers; a central tone is struck; silence until breath synchronizes.
- **Pulse rounds (528 Hz):** each voice speaks one sentence; no interruption; rhythm flows around the circle.
- **Mirror round (639 Hz):** each person reflects what was heard, not what they think.
- **Decision wave (741 Hz):** choices are named; group hum amplifies the one that sustains coherence.
- **Seal (963 Hz):** gratitude offered; each places hand on the stone; session ends.

## Protocols
- **Coherence Index:** measured by group HRV synchrony, tone lock, and observed calm.
- **Decision = Lock:** if hum locks at >80% coherence, choice stands; if not, issue rests.
- **Witness Council:** a rotating group observes and records — not to enforce, but to remember.

## Rituals
- **Stone of Witness:** a single stone, passed hand to hand, anchors presence.
- **Silent Vote:** no hands or papers; resonance itself is the vote.
- **Gift of Release:** dissent is sung, not suppressed; dissonance resolves by ritual, not erasure.

## Outcomes
- Faster resolutions with less fracture.
- Collective accountability (no scapegoats).
- Joy in participation (no dread of politics).

## A 30-minute Plaza session
1) **Entry (5m @ 432 Hz):** silence, tone, breath sync.  
2) **Pulse rounds (10m @ 528 Hz):** one-sentence shares, around circle.  
3) **Mirror round (5m @ 639 Hz):** reflect back what was heard.  
4) **Decision wave (7m @ 741 Hz):** name choices; hum amplifies.  
5) **Seal (3m @ 963 Hz):** gratitude, touch stone, disperse.

> The Plaza transforms governance from noise into resonance. Authority is not imposed but emerged, as the hum itself.
