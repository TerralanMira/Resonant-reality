# The Garden — Non-fracturing Learning

The Garden is where people **learn to resonate** instead of fracture.  
It’s education as coherence: breath → body → mind → spirit, scaled from micro to city.

---

## Pattern
- **Alignment** — settle breath, posture, attention.
- **Openness** — curiosity over certainty; “What wants to be learned?”
- **Memory** — spiral back: name what was felt, not just what was said.
- **Amplification** — small wins ritualized into shared rhythm.

> The lesson is not information transfer; it’s **field tuning**.

## Practice: Candle Intro (seed)
- **Place**: circle, no front; a single candle at center.
- **Cadence**: 3 × 3 minutes (arrive → attend → reflect).
- **Prompt**: “Notice the body’s hum; when did it get louder?”
- **Share**: one breath, one sentence; no replies, no defense.

**Why it works**  
- Circular geometry equalizes attention (no stage).  
- Time-boxed silence lets coherence rise before talk.  
- Reflection encodes memory → next spiral starts higher.

## Metrics (micro ↔ macro)
- **Kuramoto R**: short group check—do we lock more quickly each session?
- **HRV ΔRMSSD**: optional bio-signal before/after (non-mandatory).
- **Attendance Flow**: fewer late arrivals over weeks.
- **Language Drift**: “I”→“we” ratio decreases in notes.

**Falsifier hooks**
- If R does **not** increase across 3 sessions → adjust cadence/geometry.
- If HRV drops consistently → reduce load; re-open with breath work.

---

## Geometry
- Circles and gentle domes bias mode families toward coherence.
- Doors behind the circle (no one enters “through” attention focus).
- Natural light if possible; otherwise warm indirect light.

---

## From Garden to City
- **Hearths** take the same cadence into healing loops.
- **Civic Plaza** scales the circle into decision rituals (speak → still → decide).
- **Wild** teaches humility: coherence amidst uncertainty and edge conditions.
