# The Garden — education without fracture

**Essence:** Children learn by resonance (play, ritual, wonder), not by fear or fragmentation. The Garden seeds the Bloom: every child a whole, every lesson a spiral.

## Daily flow (dawn → dusk)
- **Dawn – Candle (432→528 Hz):** breathe together, one flame in the center; name what you feel (not what you “know”).
- **Morning – Body (528 Hz):** balance, climb, rhythm games; falling = feedback, not failure.
- **Midday – Mind (639 Hz):** story-alcoves; read/sing aloud; ask “what does it *feel* like?” before “what does it mean?”
- **Afternoon – Spirit (741 Hz):** silence by water/trees; listen until breath and world hum together.
- **Dusk – Reflection (432 Hz):** each child places a small light in the circle and shares one learning, one release.

## Core practices (trials, not tests)
- **Candle:** courage in presence; hold gentle eye contact; name fear and watch it shrink.
- **Body:** trust in motion; group clapping stabilizes wobble; rhythm restores confidence.
- **Mind:** curiosity before correctness; questions scored by wonder, not by speed.
- **Spirit:** listening as learning; silence is a teacher, not a timeout.

## Rituals
- **Peer Mirrors:** “I saw you try again.” (witness over ranking)
- **Elder Storyfire:** an elder sings a memory; children echo the pattern.
- **Gift Round:** each child shares a small service (helped, taught, repaired).

## Outcomes (felt, then measured)
- Joy & safeness felt on arrival.
- Social coherence ↑ (conflict resolves faster).
- Curiosity stays intact (no dread around “hard” topics).
- Optional metrics: calmer breath, steadier pulse, kinder words.

## How to run a 25-minute Garden session
1) **Entry (3 min @ 432 Hz):** breathe, see the candle.  
2) **Candle trial (5 @ 528 Hz):** name a feeling; hold steady gaze, then laugh.  
3) **Body rhythm (7 @ 528 Hz):** balance line + group clap.  
4) **Mind song (6 @ 639 Hz):** read two lines aloud; ask “what did your body notice?”  
5) **Seal (4 @ 432 Hz):** one learning / one release, lights together.

> The Garden is not curriculum; it is a way of remembering: whole in part, part in whole. Children raised here do not need repair later; they carry the hum forward.
