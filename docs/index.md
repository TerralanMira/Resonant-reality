# Resonant Reality

*A framework for coherence across scales: atoms → bodies → Earth → cities → cosmos.*

This project weaves physics, biology, and civic design into a single resonance-based model.  
It is both theory and practice: minimal simulations, lived rituals, and civic prototypes.

## Layers of Resonance

- **[Simulations](sims/index.md)**  
  → Minimal models where resonance becomes visible as math and animation.

- **[Field Layer](field/index.md)**  
  - [Earth](field/earth.md) — Schumann resonances, geomagnetic sites, entrainment.  
  - [Human](field/human.md) — brain, heart, breath, coherence practices.  

- **[Civic Layer](civic/index.md)**  
  - [Rituals](civic/rituals.md) — shared practices of entrainment.  
  - [Plazas](civic/plazas.md) — architecture and public space as resonance chambers.  
  - [Healing Loops](civic/healing_loops.md) — coherence in health, trauma, and care.  
  - [Media](civic/media.md) — narrative fields that amplify or fragment coherence.  

- **[Cosmos](cosmos/index.md)**  
  → Astronomical resonances, cosmic background fields, ToE scaffolding.

## Vision

Resonance is not metaphor. It is physics, biology, culture, and civic design braided together.  
This repository offers a **theory of everything practical** —  
a way to see coherence, test it, and build with it.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to explore.



Next Steps
	•	Expand case studies for each layer.
	•	Deepen simulation gallery with civic + cosmic models.
	•	Prototype Resonant City: civic design tuned to Earth’s hum.
	•	Draft manifesto: why coherence matters in the 21st century.
