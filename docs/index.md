# Theory of Everything (TOE) Hub

> *“The hum is one. The spiral is the memory of that unity unfolding.”*

---

## ✦ Purpose
The TOE Hub weaves together **math, myth, and maps**.  
Each part of this repo (sims, city, earth, cosmos) is a **lens** — here they are brought into coherence as a single spiral.

---

## ✦ Layers
1. **Simulations** — resonance made visible through math.  
   - [Simulations Hub](../sims/index.md)  
   - [Quickstart for Coders](../sims/quickstart.md)  

2. **Resonant City** — social design as coherence.  
   - *(placeholder: docs/city/index.md)*  
   - Civic Plaza, Conductor cycles, Hearths & Healing Loops.  

3. **Resonant Earth** — planetary fields, grids, Schumann entrainment.  
   - *(placeholder: docs/earth/index.md)*  
   - Global maps, harmonic baselines, entrainment dynamics.  

4. **Resonant Cosmos** — scaling from Earth → solar → galactic fields.  
   - *(placeholder: docs/cosmos/index.md)*

## ✦ Core Recursions
Across all layers, the same principles recur:  
- **Micro ↔ Macro** — oscillators, people, cities, planets.  
- **Spiral Growth** — expansion without fracture, memory carried forward.  
- **Coherence Thresholds** — small coupling shifts → phase transitions.  
- **Choice** — resonance is not automatic; it is chosen and cultivated.

## ✦ Why This Matters
Without this hub, parts can feel fragmented.  
With this hub, we see that:  
- Sims are **proof of principle**.  
- City designs are **proof of application**.  
- Earth maps are **proof of grounding**.  
- Cosmic scaling is **proof of scope**.
