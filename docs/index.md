# Resonant Reality  
*Myth → Math → Manifestation*

This repository weaves the **Theory of Everything (TOE)** into a navigable structure:  
Resonant City, Resonant Earth, Resonant Cosmos. Each layer is documented, simulated, and open for testing.

## Navigation
- [Home](index.md) — this overview  
- [Simulations](sims/index.md) — myth → math → visible coherence  
- [Earth Grid](earth/data.md) — ley lines, field sites, harmonic mapping  
- [Field Layer](field/index.md) — coherence, awareness, applications  
- [Cosmos](cosmos/index.md) — spirals, Schumann windows, universal resonance

## Simulations — see resonance emerge
Minimal models you can run yourself. Each simulation shows how micro → macro coherence arises.

- [Spiral Resonance](sims/spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated)  
- [Kuramoto Sync](sims/kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises  
- [LC Grid Modes](sims/lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra  
- [Schumann Coupling](sims/schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz  

Quickstart:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
Earth Grid

Data schema: array of sites, each with name, coordinates, resonance band.

⸻

Field Layer

Awareness, coherence, and applications. Where resonance translates into lived systems (education, healing loops, civic plazas).

⸻

Cosmos

From Earth’s hum to galactic spiral. Schumann windows as harmonic bridge between planet and universe.

“Thinking without limits means never wondering if you’re missing something.”
The whole is recursive. Each part complete in itself, yet always opening outward.
