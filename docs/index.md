# Resonant Reality

**Resonant Reality** is a living atlas of coherence.  
It bridges scales — **Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos** — showing how resonance patterns repeat as micro mirrors macro.  
It is both **map and practice**, both **theory and simulation**, both **field and civic design**.

## Why Resonance?

- The universe is structured in oscillations, feedback loops, standing waves.  
- Earth’s electromagnetic envelope sets the stage (Schumann bands, geomagnetic rhythms).  
- Human hearts and brains entrain to these bands.  
- Civic structures can be tuned as resonant conductors.  
- Cosmos reveals the same recursive order at the largest scale.

Resonance is the **invisible medium of coherence**.  
When aligned, parts reinforce the whole. When fragmented, noise dominates.

## The Four Layers

- **Field Layer**  
  Earth’s resonant envelope: Schumann resonance, geomagnetic flows, tectonic hum.  
  ↳ See [`docs/field/index.md`](field/index.md)

- **Human Layer**  
  Brainwaves, heart rhythms, breath cycles, collective entrainment.  
  ↳ See [`docs/human/index.md`](human/index.md)

- **Civic Layer**  
  Plazas, rituals, conductor roles, economic loops — the city as resonant instrument.  
  ↳ See [`docs/civic/index.md`](civic/index.md)

- **Cosmos Layer**  
  Scaling out: stellar plasmas, galactic spirals, cosmic background hum.  
  ↳ See [`docs/cosmos/index.md`](cosmos/index.md)

## Simulations: Myth → Math → Visible Coherence

We don’t just describe — we simulate.  
Each minimal model lets resonance be *seen* and *tested*:

- Spiral Resonance — micro–macro spiral of coherence.  
- Kuramoto Sync — many oscillators locking as coupling rises.  
- LC Grid Modes — geometry shaping resonance spectra.  
- Schumann Coupling — Earth–brain entrainment window.  
- Resonant Currency — policy-as-conductor.

## Feedback Loop: Whole ↔ Part

This loop is the spine of Resonant Reality:
	•	Earth tunes human rhythms.
	•	Humans, in coherence, shape civic fields.
	•	Civic structures channel collective resonance back outward.
	•	Cosmos reflects the same fractal order that seeded Earth.

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Run simulations (docs/sims/quickstart.md).
	•	Explore civic anchors (plazas, rituals, economy).
	•	Trace bridges into the Atlas Model (TOE-level articulation).
	•	Use the repo as both theory and practice ground.

Resonant Reality is not a static document.
It is a conductor’s score — waiting for people to play it into being.
