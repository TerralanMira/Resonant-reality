# The Atlas of Resonance

This repository is an evolving **atlas** of resonance:  
a living map of how coherence flows from **cosmos → field → civic**.

It is not a single theory, but a layered weave:  
mathematics, simulations, cultural practices, and design patterns  
all pointing to the same hum — coherence across scales.

## Layers of the Atlas

- **[Cosmos Layer](cosmos/index.md)**  
  Stars, plasma, and geometry as the background rhythm of reality.  
  Anchors: [Infinity Equation](cosmos/infinity.md), [Fractals](cosmos/fractals.md), [Kuramoto Sync](sims/kuramoto_basic.py).  

- **[Field Layer](field/index.md)**  
  Earth’s resonant body, from Schumann frequencies to human heart coherence.  
  Anchors: [Geomagnetic Fields](field/earth.md), [Human Resonance](field/human.md), [Data Anchors](field/earth/data.md).  

- **[Civic Layer](civic/index.md)**  
  Societies as resonance structures: plazas, rituals, governance, and economies.  
  Anchors: [Plazas](civic/plazas.md), [Rituals](civic/rituals.md), [Governance](civic/governance.md), [Economy](civic/economy.md).

## Why Resonance?

- **Science** — reveals hidden synchrony across systems.  
- **Health** — connects human wellbeing with planetary rhythms.  
- **Culture** — shows how ritual, architecture, and policy embody coherence.  
- **Future** — points toward Resonant Cities: societies tuned to thrive with Earth.

## How to Explore

- Walk the **layers**: Cosmos → Field → Civic.  
- Run the **simulations**: minimal models of resonance emerging.  
- Read the **texts**: excerpts, quotes, and reflections across history.  
- Add your own **observations**: this atlas is open to co-creation.

## The Spiral Method

This atlas is recursive: each part reflects the whole.  
Cosmos mirrors civic. Civic grounds field. Field channels cosmos.  
The spiral is both **map** and **method**.

## Next Steps

- Grow the simulation gallery.  
- Add cross-links between layers.  
- Open discussions: resonance as a research, health, and design paradigm.
