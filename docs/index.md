# Resonant Reality

*A living framework tracing the hum of coherence across scales —  
Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos — weaving field, practice, and simulation into one whole.*

---

## Orientation

Resonant Reality begins with a simple premise: **the world hums**.  
Earth generates standing waves (Schumann resonances), the human body entrains to them,  
civic life reflects them in ritual and design, and the cosmos frames them in infinite recursion.  

This repo is both **atlas and laboratory**:
- An **atlas**, mapping resonance across layers.
- A **laboratory**, offering simulations, prototypes, and practices.

It is not doctrine but invitation: a framework to **explore, test, and extend**.

## The Four Layers

### 🌍 Earth Layer
Planetary resonances anchor the whole system:
- Schumann frequencies as background rhythm.
- Geomagnetic storms as disruptions.
- Cross-links to geophysical anchor sites.

👉 See: [`docs/field/earth.md`](field/earth.md)

---

### 🧍 Human Layer
The body as resonant instrument:
- Brainwaves overlapping with Schumann bands.
- Heart rhythms entraining with geomagnetic calm.
- Breath cycles as a voluntary bridge.

👉 See: [`docs/field/human.md`](field/human.md)

---

### 🏛 Civic Layer
Society as resonant architecture:
- Plazas, hearths, and gathering sites as amplifiers.
- Rituals as synchronization technology.
- Economy, governance, and education as coherence systems.

👉 See: [`docs/civic/index.md`](civic/index.md)

---

### ✨ Cosmic Layer
The wider field:
- The infinity equation (∞ = 0 ↔ 1).
- Scaling laws across galactic and quantum domains.
- Speculative maps of coherence at universal levels.

👉 See: [`docs/cosmos/index.md`](cosmos/index.md)

## Feedback Loop

At the heart of Resonant Reality is a **recursive feedback loop**:

**Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos**

- Earth provides resonance →  
- Human entrains and amplifies →  
- Civic structures stabilize and broadcast →  
- Cosmos frames and reflects → back to Earth.

Each layer is **part of the whole and the whole within each part**.

## Simulations

Simulations serve as **toy models** — not proofs, but lenses:  

- **Resonant Currency** — token supply adjusting to coherence index.  
- **The Atlas Model** — civic scaffolding as resonant network.  
- **Plaza Simulation** — local fields of synchrony.  

👉 See: [`docs/sims/index.md`](sims/index.md)

## How to Use This Repo

- **Explore**: Start with the [Books](../01_Books/) knowledge bank.  
- **Practice**: Try coherence techniques in [`field/human.md`](field/human.md).  
- **Prototype**: Run simulations in [`sims/`](sims/).  
- **Extend**: Fork and add new anchors, cross-links, or toy models.  

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Resonance over reduction** — the whole is felt as much as measured.  
- **Part in whole, whole in part** — recursion as structure.  
- **Symmetry, coherence, feedback** — design anchors at every scale.  
- **Living document** — this atlas is always becoming.  

---

## Next Steps

- Add more **cross-maps** between sims and civic docs.  
- Expand **cosmos layer** with deeper speculative anchors.  
- Develop **bridging doc** linking Resonant Reality ↔ Atlas Model.

*Resonant Reality is not an answer but a rhythm.  
To engage with it is to listen for coherence, and to let the hum guide you.*
