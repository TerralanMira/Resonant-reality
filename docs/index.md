# Resonant Reality

*A living atlas of coherence — tracing resonance across physics, earth, human, and civic layers.*  
From myth → math → simulation → application.  
This is not a fixed theory, but a resonant field to enter, refine, and extend.

## 🌌 Cosmic Coherence

The universe is vibration first, form second.  
Resonance is the hidden order through which systems self-organize:  
spirals in galaxies, oscillations in atoms, rhythms in life.

Key anchors:
- Waves couple across scale (micro ↔ macro).
- Synchrony stabilizes systems.
- Coherence generates energy efficiency.

## 🌍 Earth Layer

Earth is a resonant body — atmosphere, crust, and ionosphere form cavities that sing.

- **Schumann resonances**: global EM modes, fundamental ~7.83 Hz.  
- **Geomagnetic rhythms**: daily and seasonal pulsations entraining living systems.  
- **Seismic/acoustic echoes**: Earth’s crust as a vibrating drum.  

See: [`docs/field/earth/data.md`](field/earth/data.md)

## 🧠 Human Resonance

The body is tuned to Earth’s frequencies.  
Brainwaves, heart rhythms, and breath cycles all fall within planetary bands.

- **Brainwaves**: Delta → Theta → Alpha → Beta → Gamma.  
  ↳ Schumann overlaps alpha–theta transition.  
- **Heart coherence**: HRV entrains with breath & geomagnetic calm.  
- **Breath cycles**: ~0.1 Hz coherent breathing bridges voluntary and involuntary systems.

## 🏙 Civic Resonance

Cities are fields of fields: plazas, hearths, schools, rituals, and economies all act as resonant chambers.  
Civic design can amplify coherence the way a conductor synchronizes an orchestra.

Anchors:
- **Plazas** → civic-scale resonance chambers.  
- **Rituals** → patterned practices that align collective rhythms.  
- **Education** → knowledge as resonance transmission.  
- **Governance** → decision as synchrony.  
- **Economy** → flow of tokens/resources as frequency.

## 🧪 Simulations — myth → math → visible coherence

Minimal models that let anyone *see* resonance emerge.  
Each sim is both playful and testable: falsifiable myths.

- **Spiral Resonance** — micro ↔ macro spiral of coherence  
- **Kuramoto Sync** — oscillators locking with coupling  
- **LC Grid Modes** — geometry shaping resonance spectra  
- **Schumann Coupling** — entrainment at ~7.83 Hz  
- **Resonant Currency** — coherence-indexed token economy  

See: [`docs/sims/index.md`](sims/index.md)

## 🔭 Why This Matters

Resonance is not metaphorical — it is measurable.  
What we call “society” and “consciousness” ride on physical rhythms.  
By tuning design to resonance, we can stabilize fragile systems, amplify vitality, and align civic life with planetary cycles.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Run the simulations in `/sims` and contribute new ones.  
- Add datasets (HRV, geomagnetic indices, urban rhythms).  
- Prototype civic designs: plazas, rituals, resonant currencies.  
- Treat this as a *living document*: fork, extend, hum back.

**Resonant Reality is not finished — it is a field to be tuned.**
