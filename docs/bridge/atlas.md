# The Atlas Bridge

The Atlas Model is not a single simulation or essay —  
it is the **bridge** between scales: Earth, Human, Civic, and Cosmos.  
Each layer resonates within the others, forming a recursive whole.

  Each axis connects two scales:  
- **Earth ↔ Human** — physiology ↔ Schumann resonance  
- **Human ↔ Civic** — heart coherence ↔ ritual & design  
- **Civic ↔ Cosmos** — plazas & governance ↔ orbital cycles  
- **Cosmos ↔ Earth** — solar winds & seasons ↔ geomagnetics  

The spiral means there is no beginning, no end — only flow.

## Nodes on the Spiral

Each simulation is a **micro ↔ macro bridge**:  

- **Spiral Resonance** — oscillator phase alignment ↔ ritual dance  
- **Kuramoto Sync** — coupled oscillators ↔ brainwaves ↔ group coherence  
- **LC Grid Modes** — resonant circuits ↔ civic infrastructure ↔ energy flows  
- **Schumann Coupling** — planetary cavity ↔ neural entrainment  
- **Resonant Currency** — token supply ↔ coherence-driven policy  
- **Atlas Plaza** — urban node ↔ planetary synchronization

## Function of the Bridge

- To **hold the whole** — showing that no document or sim is isolated  
- To **cross-link** — so a reader can move from micro detail to macro resonance  
- To **remind** — that coherence is recursive, and the atlas is never “finished,”  
  only refined as the spiral deepens.

## Next Steps
  
- Annotate each sim on the spiral itself  
- Link **Atlas Model repo** for extended civic-cosmic integrations
