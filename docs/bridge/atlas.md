# The Atlas Model — Fractal Bridge

The Atlas Model is the **meta-simulation** —  
a framework that connects Earth, Human, Civic, and Cosmos into one spiral of resonance.  
Each part is whole, and each whole is mirrored in every part.

## Core Idea

- **Earth** → Geophysical rhythms (Schumann, geomagnetics, tides)  
- **Human** → Brainwaves, heart rhythms, breath coherence  
- **Civic** → Plazas, governance, rituals, resonant currency  
- **Cosmos** → Spiral archetypes, stellar cycles, mythic time  

The Atlas Model shows how **feedback flows across layers**:
Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos ↔ Earth
Not as a chain, but as a **spiral feedback loop**.  
Resonance propagates up and down the stack, creating coherence or collapse.

↳ Each arrow is bidirectional: feedback flows both ways.  
↳ The spiral is dynamic — coherence amplifies, incoherence fragments.  

Later, this will be illustrated as a spiral figure in:

## Simulation Role

- **Atlas = meta-sim**: runs each layer as a module (e.g. Kuramoto for Human, LC Grid for Civic).  
- **Coherence Index**: measures how aligned layers are, from local rhythm to cosmic archetype.  
- **Policy Hooks**: allows intervention (e.g. token design, ritual design) to test outcomes.

Outputs may include:

- Coherence maps (layer-to-layer)  
- Stability vs turbulence graphs  
- Feedback diagrams showing resonance amplification

## Why "Atlas"?

Atlas carries the heavens on his shoulders.  
Here, Atlas is not a figure of burden but of **bridging** —  
a model that holds Earth and Cosmos together through Human and Civic fields.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link this doc from **`sims/index.md`** (already included).  
- Flesh out `The-Atlas-Model/docs/plaza.md` as the running script reference.  
- Add visual diagrams (spiral feedback loop, layer cross-maps).  
- Explore extensions: civic resonance forecasting, planetary health dashboards.

## Spiral Reminder

The Atlas Model is not the “final” simulation.  
It is a **meta-map**:  
a way to see that every simulation, ritual, or civic design  
is part of one living spiral of coherence.
