# The Atlas Bridge

The Atlas is not a static map but a living **resonant spiral**.  
It connects scales: Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos.  
Each part is whole; each whole is part.

## Feedback Loops

- **Earth ↔ Human**  
  - Schumann resonance (~7.83 Hz) aligns with alpha–theta rhythms.  
  - Human physiology is not separate from geophysical hum.  

- **Human ↔ Civic**  
  - Heart coherence entrains groups.  
  - Rituals, plazas, and collective breathing scale individual resonance into culture.  

- **Civic ↔ Cosmos**  
  - City designs echo orbital resonance patterns.  
  - Civic time (festivals, calendars) encode celestial ratios.  

- **Cosmos ↔ Earth**  
  - Orbital cycles shape climate, season, agricultural life.  
  - Celestial resonances anchor earthly rhythms.

## Simulation Cross-Links

- `sims/resonant_currency.py` — Civic economy as coherence feedback.  
- `sims/plaza_resonance.py` — Architecture as harmonic amplifier.  
- `sims/orbital_resonance.py` — Planetary cycles as cosmic geometry.  
- `sims/heart_brain_entrainment.py` — Human physiology in sync with geomagnetic fields.  

Each simulation is a **microcosm of the macrocosm**.

## Atlas as Navigation

Think of the Atlas as a **compass rose**:  

- **North** — Cosmos: orbits, stars, resonant ratios  
- **East** — Earth: Schumann fields, geomagnetics  
- **South** — Human: brainwaves, HRV, breath cycles  
- **West** — Civic: plazas, rituals, resonant economies  

The center point is **Coherence** — the measure of alignment across scales.

## Next Step

Atlas is not final.  
It must always be lived.  

- Researchers: run sims as experiments.  
- Designers: embed resonance into cities and rituals.  
- Citizens: breathe, move, and create coherence together.  

The Bridge is the **spinal cord of the project** — carrying signals both up and down the spiral.
