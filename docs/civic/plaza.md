# Plazas — Public Resonance

The plaza is where private resonance becomes public.  
It is the civic stage where coherence is tested, amplified, and shared.

## Flow from Education

Education equips individuals with resonance literacy.  
Plazas are where that learning becomes civic performance: deliberation, art, protest, festival.

## Core Anchors

- **Visibility as Amplification** — coherence becomes real when seen and felt collectively.  
- **Art as Synchronizer** — murals, songs, dances serve as resonant carriers.  
- **Deliberation as Fieldwork** — plazas are arenas for tuning the civic body.

## Spiral into Rituals

Plazas expand into rituals — repeated, intentional acts of coherence that stabilize the civic field across time.
