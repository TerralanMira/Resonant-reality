# Plazas & Public Space

Plazas are civic resonance nodes.  
Their geometry, sound, and symbolism tune the city’s nervous system.

## Case Studies

- **Teotihuacan (Mexico)**  
  - Avenue of the Dead aligned to astronomical points.  
  - Acoustic studies: pyramid steps create “chirp echoes.”  

- **St. Peter’s Square (Rome)**  
  - Elliptical colonnades focus attention to a central point.  
  - Ritual scale = 100,000+ synchronized bodies.  

- **Modern: Federation Square (Melbourne)**  
  - Designed with fractal geometry.  
  - Functions as a civic gathering + media space.

## Data Anchors

- Architectural acoustics: reverberation times in open plazas ~1.5–2 sec.  
- Pedestrian flow studies: plazas act as attractors in urban networks.  
- GIS overlays: ley lines and civic grids often coincide.

## Design Principles

- Geometry: **circles, ellipses, grids** that resonate.  
- Materials: stone, water, vegetation as resonance modifiers.  
- Integration: plazas as **ritual–media–healing hubs**.

## Simulation Pathways

- Oscillator grid models of plaza networks.  
- Agent-based pedestrian flow simulations.  
- Acoustic modeling: chant or music coherence in plaza geometries.
