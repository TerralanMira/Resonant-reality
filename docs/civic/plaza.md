# Plaza â€” Resonant Commons

The **plaza** is the heart of civic resonance.  
It is not only a space for gathering, but a **tuning chamber** for the city.  
Its geometry, acoustics, and rhythms invite coherence at scale.

## Principles

- **Geometry**  
  Circular or spiral forms encourage inclusion.  
  Ratios drawn from harmonic series (1:2, 2:3, 3:4) reinforce resonance.  

- **Acoustics**  
  Materials and curvature amplify natural frequencies.  
  The plaza becomes an **ear** for the city.  

- **Flow**  
  Entry points align with natural pathways (geomagnetic lines, waterways, or pedestrian flows).  
  Movement in and out mirrors breath.  

- **Use**  
  From daily markets to collective meditation, the plaza holds both the ordinary and the sacred.

## Functions

- **Tuning Fork**  
  Group gatherings sync heart rhythms, voices, and movements.  

- **Civic Field Anchor**  
  The plaza grounds collective energy into the field grid.  

- **Cultural Spiral**  
  Performances, rituals, and storytelling transmit coherence into memory.

## Simulation Ideas

- **Acoustic Field Models**: Simulate sound propagation through plaza geometries.  
- **Crowd Coherence Metrics**: Measure HRV synchronization across groups.  
- **Field Coupling**: Map plaza placement against geomagnetic lines.

## Next Steps

- Add diagrams of resonant plaza designs.  
- Link to **Hearths (hearths.md)** for intimate coherence spaces.  
- Link to **Conduits (conduits.md)** for connecting civic flows.
