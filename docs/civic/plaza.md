# Plazas & Public Space

Civic architecture is resonance made visible.  
Plazas, temples, amphitheaters, and gathering places act as coherence chambers.

## Anchors

- **Geometry & Acoustics**  
  - Circular plazas → phase-locking spaces.  
  - Amphitheaters → focus sound into shared rhythm.  
  - Sacred geometry as resonance amplifier.  

- **Urban Ley Lines**  
  - Street grids can guide flows like circuits.  
  - Nodes (plazas) act as capacitors for collective charge.  
  - Resonant city = tuned instrument.  

- **Soundscapes & Lightscapes**  
  - Bells, fountains, chants, public art.  
  - Ambient resonance stabilizes nervous systems.  
  - Public light cycles = circadian entrainment.

## Functions

- Anchor group coherence into physical form.  
- Provide **ritual stages** and **healing loops**.  
- Act as civic “resonance nodes” in the urban network.

## Implications

A city is only as healthy as its plazas.  
If plazas hum, the whole urban nervous system stabilizes.

## Next Steps

- Add **sketches** and blueprints for resonant plazas.  
- Link to **Conductor Layer** for feedback/dashboard integration.  
- Simulate plaza networks as oscillator grids.
