# Media & Signal

Narrative is frequency.  
Media carries coherence — or noise.  
Civic signal decides whether cultures entrain to wisdom or distraction.  

---

## Anchors

- **Song & Story**  
  - Oral tradition as coherence keeper.  
  - Myths as frequency codes, not just tales.  

- **Symbol & Meme**  
  - Shared icons and slogans entrain attention.  
  - Meme = informational resonance packet.  

- **Broadcast & Platform**  
  - Technology amplifies signal/noise.  
  - Design choice: coherence loops or outrage loops?  

---

## Functions

- Align cultural attention to shared rhythm.  
- Carry memory across generations.  
- Act as “phase couplers” between groups.  

---

## Implications

Media is civic nervous tissue.  
Bad media = civic arrhythmia.  
Good media = distributed coherence.

## Next Steps

- Map signal pathways in urban contexts (plaza ↔ media ↔ ritual).  
- Prototype coherence-first platforms.  
- Simulate meme dynamics as oscillators competing for phase-lock.
