# Media & Signal

Media is nervous tissue.  
It determines whether a city entrains into coherence or noise.

## Case Studies

- **Oral Tradition (West Africa Griots)**  
  - Story as frequency carrier.  
  - Cultural memory transmitted across centuries.  

- **Radio Broadcasts (WWII Britain)**  
  - Churchillâ€™s radio addresses entrained collective morale.  
  - Coherence as resistance technology.  

- **Twitter & Outrage Loops (21st century)**  
  - Phase-locking into stress, polarization.  
  - Media as civic arrhythmia.

## Data Anchors

- Memetic diffusion models: memes spread like phase-locking oscillators.  
- Nielsen data: collective attention cycles (TV, streaming).  
- HRV shifts linked to exposure to positive vs negative media.  

---

## Design Principles

- Use **story as signal**.  
- Design **coherence-first platforms**.  
- Weave media into plazas, rituals, healing loops.

## Simulation Pathways

- Model meme resonance as oscillator competition.  
- Test coherence vs outrage algorithms.  
- Simulate how narrative shifts alter urban stress maps.
