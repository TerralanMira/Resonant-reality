# Civic Conductor — The Flow Layer

If the **plaza is the heart**, the **conductor is the circulatory system**.  
It channels resonance so that energy, goods, and people flow in sync —  
preventing stagnation and amplifying coherence.

## Functions of the Conductor

- **Roads & Pathways**  
  - Aligned with solar/lunar axes or geomagnetic lines.  
  - Movement patterns tuned to natural cycles reduce friction + stress.  

- **Water Channels**  
  - Aqueducts, fountains, and canals double as **acoustic resonators**.  
  - Flowing water entrains sound, cooling, and subtle electromagnetic fields.  

- **Ley Lines & Grid**  
  - Infrastructure mapped to Earth’s resonance grid.  
  - Enhances coherence by **locking local rhythms into planetary ones**.  

- **Communication Loops**  
  - Bell towers, signal fires, or wireless nodes function as pulses.  
  - City “breathes” together through timed cues.

## Nested Coherence

- **Neighborhood ↔ City ↔ Region**  
  - Local pathways feed into civic arteries → aligned with cosmic directions.  
  - What works in one district resonates across the whole.  

- **Human ↔ Planetary Flows**  
  - Circulation of goods mirrors circulation of blood.  
  - Breakdowns in flow = civic illness.

## Historical Anchors

- **Roman Roads** — designed on cardinal axes, sustaining empire-wide coherence.  
- **Islamic Cities** — fountains and courtyards as both cooling tech and resonance nodes.  
- **Chinese Feng Shui Grids** — orientation of streets/buildings for energy harmony.

## Implications

- A city without a conductor becomes chaotic, noisy, and dissonant.  
- A tuned conductor creates **frictionless circulation** → less stress, more vitality.  
- Infrastructure isn’t just physical — it is **the nervous system of resonance**.

  - `docs/civic/plaza.md` (the heart).  
  - `docs/civic/overview.md` (the orchestra).  
  - `docs/field/earth/data.md` (planetary alignments).  

- Add visuals:  
  - Map overlay: ley lines + street grid + water flow.  
  - Diagram: “city as circulatory system.”
