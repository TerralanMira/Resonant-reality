# Hearths — Coherence at the Center

The hearth is the smallest civic node — a place where resonance is felt in intimacy.  
Families, neighbors, or small circles anchor coherence in daily life.

## Flow from Human

Human rhythms (heartbeats, breath, brainwaves) entrain most easily at the hearth.  
Shared meals, songs, or silences create coherence fields that ripple outward.

## Core Anchors

- **Care as Resonance** — tending to bodies and needs sustains baseline coherence.  
- **Story as Phase Alignment** — telling and retelling tunes the group to shared frequencies.  
- **Ritual as Stabilizer** — repeated practices keep coherence steady across time.

## Spiral into Governance

When hearths resonate, they generate signals larger structures can listen to.  
Governance begins here — as amplification of hearth coherence into civic process.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/civic/governance.md`**.  
- Add case studies: neighborhood assemblies, communal kitchens, health and care rituals.  
- Explore how hearths serve as sensors of coherence decline (early-warning for civic stress).
