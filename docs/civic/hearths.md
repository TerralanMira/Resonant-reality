# Hearths — Healing Loops

The **hearth** is the smallest civic coherence space.  
Where the **plaza** gathers many, the hearth gathers few.  
It is where **trust, story, and healing** circulate.

## Principles

- **Scale**  
  4–12 people — the number of voices that can truly listen.  

- **Shape**  
  Circle or semicircle.  
  Fire, fountain, or shared center creates a **magnetic anchor**.  

- **Flow**  
  Conversation, silence, or chant flows in **turns**, not dominance.  

- **Energy**  
  Safe enough for vulnerability, strong enough for truth.

## Functions

- **Healing Loop**  
  Restores coherence at the personal and interpersonal scale.  

- **Story Transmission**  
  Myths, memories, and visions are shared — weaving narrative fields.  

- **Bridge**  
  Hearth coherence can scale upward, linking to plazas and institutions.

## Simulation Ideas

- **Group HRV Models**: Explore coherence in small groups.  
- **Narrative Dynamics**: Model how stories circulate in loops.  
- **Fractal Scaling**: Show how multiple hearths seed larger coherence networks.

## Next Steps

- Add sketches of hearth spaces (fire circles, resonant domes).  
- Link to **Plaza (plaza.md)** as the next civic scale.  
- Link to **Conduits (conduits.md)** for movement between hearths.
