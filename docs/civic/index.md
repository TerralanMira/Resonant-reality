# Civic Layer — Resonant City in Practice

The civic layer is where resonance becomes visible in culture.  
It is the scale of plazas, hearths, councils, and festivals —  
the living patterns that hold communities in coherence.

## Anchors of the Civic

- **Hearths** — the smallest civic coherence nodes, where meals, fire, and intimacy center daily life.  
- **Loops** — relational circuits of care, exchange, and communication that keep resonance circulating.  
- **Design** — the geometry of plazas, streets, and gathering spaces that make collective coherence possible.  
- **Rituals** — the embodied practices that weave time, memory, and emotion into civic resonance.

## Civic Resonance Principles

- **Micro ↔ Macro Alignment**  
  - A fire circle resonates with a civic plaza  
  - A local festival resonates with a solstice ceremony  

- **Fractal Governance**  
  - Hearth → Neighborhood → City → Region  
  - Each level amplifies and stabilizes the ones below  

- **Entrainment Windows**  
  - Civic gatherings pulse at frequencies that overlap with heart, breath, and Schumann bands  
  - Resonance is amplified when architecture and ritual align with these bands

## Implications

- **Urban Design**  
  Cities can be planned as resonant instruments rather than extractive grids.  

- **Collective Healing**  
  Civic coherence reduces polarization, stress, and fragmentation.  

- **Cultural Regeneration**  
  Rituals and hearths maintain living traditions while adapting to new contexts.

## Next Steps

- Flesh out links to:  
  - [Hearths](hearths.md)  
  - [Loops](loops.md)  
  - [Design](design.md)  
  - [Rituals](rituals.md)  

- Add visual diagrams of civic fractals (plaza ↔ hearth ↔ city).  
- Simulate **festival entrainment** in `/sims/civic/`.
