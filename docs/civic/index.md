# Civic Resonance

Civic life is where coherence becomes visible and shared.  
Plazas, rituals, governance, and economy are not separate “sectors” —  
they are phases of a spiral: each one unfolds from the last, feeding the next.

## Spiral Sequence

1. **Conductor — The Civic Field**  
   The shared “atmosphere” of a city.  
   Architecture, soundscapes, and rhythms set the background resonance.

2. **Plazas — Spaces of Gathering**  
   Civic plazas act as resonant chambers.  
   Design, geometry, and flow amplify coherence from private to collective.

3. **Rituals — Binding Time**  
   Once gathered, people weave shared meaning.  
   Rituals entrain heartbeats, breaths, and voices to the civic field.

4. **Governance — Resonance in Decision**  
   From ritual coherence, governance emerges.  
   Councils and assemblies become more than debate: they become tuning.

5. **Economy — Circulation of Resonance**  
   Value is not abstracted extraction but circulation of coherence.  
   Tokens, trade, and work distribute and sustain resonant surplus.

Each civic anchor is not static, but a phase in a cycle.
	•	Conductor sets the tone.
	•	Plazas gather bodies.
	•	Rituals weave meaning.
	•	Governance channels choice.
	•	Economy circulates energy.
And the cycle renews.

## Spiral Bridge

The **Civic layer** is a resonant mediator.  
Communities act as tuning bodies between the **Human** and the **Cosmos**, grounded in Earth.

Next Steps
	•	Flesh out cross-links: each civic file should begin with “Flow from previous, into next.”
	•	Add case studies: Athens agora, Gothic cathedrals, Burning Man, cooperative markets.
	•	Integrate with simulations: e.g., resonant currency models economy as conductor feedback.
