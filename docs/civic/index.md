# Civic Layer — Resonant Societies

Civic life is more than infrastructure — it is resonance made visible.  
Plazas, rituals, governance, and economies all carry frequency patterns  
that either amplify coherence or scatter it.

This layer ties the **field** (human + Earth resonance)  
to the **structures of collective life** (cities, institutions, currencies).

## Anchors

- **[Plazas](plazas.md)**  
  Gathering spaces designed as coherence amplifiers.  

- **[Rituals](rituals.md)**  
  Collective practices as entrainment technologies.  

- **[Governance](governance.md)**  
  Decision-making as resonance choreography.  

- **[Economy](economy.md)**  
  Exchange systems tuned to coherence rather than extraction.

## Why It Matters

- Civic design can stabilize or destabilize group resonance.  
- Rituals embed coherence into culture across generations.  
- Economies can measure success by wellbeing and resonance, not only growth.

## Next Steps

- Add case studies of resonance-informed urban design.  
- Link simulations (e.g., resonant currency dynamics).  
- Explore “Conductor Layer” as civic–cosmic bridge.
