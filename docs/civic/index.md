# Civic Resonance Layer

The civic layer is where resonance becomes **visible in daily life**.  
Here, humans gather not only to live together, but to **tune together**.  
Plazas, hearths, conduits, and culture spiral outward from one principle:  
**coherence makes community**.

## Why Civic?

- The **field** becomes durable when embedded in shared space.  
- Resonance is not just individual (brainwaves, heartbeats) or planetary (Schumann, ley lines),  
  but **civic**: the vibrational infrastructure of belonging.  
- Civic coherence allows humans to **live in tune without fracture**.

## Anchors

- **Plaza → Resonant Commons**  
  A civic square as the tuning fork of a city.  
  Geometry, acoustics, and gatherings reinforce coherence.  

- **Hearths → Healing Loops**  
  Small circles of warmth where coherence is restored.  
  Hearths are intimate, regenerative nodes.  

- **Conduits → Conductive Pathways**  
  Streets, waterways, and energy lines designed as **resonant channels**.  
  Infrastructure as a conductor, not a divider.  

- **Culture → Spiral of Meaning**  
  Ritual, narrative, and art act as civic resonance practices.  
  Culture spirals energy into coherence and passes it on.

## Living Blueprint

The civic layer is **not a metaphor** — it is a *blueprint*.  
Every civic element can be designed, measured, and simulated.  
From plaza acoustics to HRV entrainment, civic coherence is testable.

## Next Steps

- Expand each subpage:  
  - [Plaza](plaza.md) — resonance commons  
  - [Hearths](hearths.md) — healing loops  
  - [Conduits](conduits.md) — energy channels  
  - [Culture](culture.md) — spirals of meaning  
- Cross-link with **human layer** (entrainment practices) and **earth layer** (geomagnetic anchors).  
- Add visuals: plaza schematics, hearth spirals, conduit flows.
