# Civic Layer — City as Resonant Body

If the human is a resonant instrument,  
then the city is an orchestra.  
Its plazas, hearths, and assemblies  
are not random spaces — they are organs of coherence.  

When citizens breathe together, chant together,  
or simply walk in rhythm across shared plazas,  
their **collective field amplifies**.  
What begins as an individual alpha wave,  
a heartbeat, a drumbeat,  
scales upward into civic resonance.  

Civic design is therefore not neutral —  
it can tune a people into harmony or scatter them into noise.  
A square designed for spectacle produces dissonance.  
A hearth designed for gathering produces coherence.  

The task of resonant civics is simple yet profound:  
**design cities as instruments of collective entrainment.**

- [Plazas](plazas.md) — geometry of gathering and harmonic scaling  
- [Rituals](rituals.md) — repeating rhythms that lock groups into phase  
- [Hearths](hearths.md) — intimate coherence at small scale  
- [Governance](governance.md) — policy as frequency calibration  
- [Economy](economy.md) — resonant currency and circulation models
- What this does:
	•	Extends body → polis using the metaphor of instrument → orchestra.
	•	Sets the stage for all civic anchors as resonance technologies.
	•	Bridges naturally into governance & economy, where policies = tuning knobs.
