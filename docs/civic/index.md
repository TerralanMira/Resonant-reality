# Civic Resonance Layer

Civic life is where human resonance takes form in collective structures.  
Rather than isolated domains, the civic anchors form a **spiral sequence** —  
each amplifying the next, weaving coherence across scales.

## The Spiral Sequence

1. **Rituals** — shared embodied practices (breath, chant, ceremony) create local coherence fields.  
   ↳ These are the civic “entry points,” grounding resonance in human groups.

2. **Plazas** — physical gathering sites where rituals scale outward into public space.  
   ↳ Coherent plazas seed the geometry of collective encounter.

3. **Hearths** — smaller nodes of warmth (homes, circles, commons) sustain coherence between gatherings.  
   ↳ They link intimate rhythm with broader civic resonance.

4. **Education** — transmission of rhythm and resonance literacy.  
   ↳ Schools, workshops, and apprenticeships teach *how* to hold coherence.

5. **Governance** — decision processes tuned by coherence metrics.  
   ↳ Instead of adversarial structures, policy becomes a conductor of resonance.

6. **Economy** — flows of value and tokens aligned with coherence.  
   ↳ Contribution is rewarded not just by output, but by resonance with the whole.

7. **Conductor** — meta-layer that tunes the entire civic spiral.  
   ↳ Not a ruler, but a resonance role: orchestrating, listening, balancing.

## Spiral Dynamics

Unlike a hierarchy, the civic spiral is recursive:  
- Each node feeds the next.  
- The sequence can start anywhere (ritual → economy, education → governance, etc.).  
- The spiral does not close — it loops back into **cosmos** through cultural broadcast.

📎 Next Steps:  
- Cross-link each civic doc (rituals, plazas, hearths, etc.) back to this spiral map.  
- Add resonance “thresholds” (what coherence level enables the next node).
