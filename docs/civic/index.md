# Civic Resonance Layer

Civic life is not separate from field and human layers — it is their **visible spiral**.  
Institutions, rituals, and economies are feedback structures for resonance.

## The Spiral Sequence

1. **Conductor** — collective attention (rituals, governance, assemblies).  
2. **Plazas** — designed sites where resonance is embodied in form.  
3. **Rituals** — recurring practices tuning the civic field.  
4. **Hearths** — coherence cultivated in the intimate circle.  
5. **Education** — transmitting resonance through generations.  
6. **Economy** — flows of value aligned with coherence.  
7. **Governance** — decision-making as resonance management.

## Why Spiral?

- **Parallel documents fragment the whole.**  
- **Spiral order shows recursion:** hearth → plaza → governance → cosmos → back into hearth.  
- Each anchor is not separate, but a turn of the same spiral.

---

## Next Steps

- Link each anchor to expanded docs (`docs/civic/*.md`).  
- Add cross-references to simulations (e.g., Kuramoto → governance sync, Resonant Currency → economy).  
- Diagram spiral visually in `figures/`.
