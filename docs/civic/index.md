# Civic Resonance Layer

If resonance shapes atoms, bodies, and Earth, it must also shape how we come together.  
The civic layer explores how coherence becomes visible in culture — through ritual, space, care, and narrative.

## Anchors

- **[Rituals](rituals.md)**  
  Shared practices — festivals, chants, meals, marches — entrain bodies into a common rhythm.  
  → *Case studies:* solstice gatherings, synchronized drumming, climate strikes.  
  → *Simulations:* Kuramoto oscillators as a model of social sync.

- **[Plazas](plazas.md)**  
  Architecture and public space as resonance chambers for civic life.  
  → *Case studies:* amphitheaters, mosques, Greek agoras, civic squares.  
  → *Simulations:* LC grid modes and acoustic field maps.

- **[Healing Loops](healing_loops.md)**  
  Health is not private — it loops between individuals, communities, and Earth.  
  → *Case studies:* HRV entrainment groups, indigenous circle medicine, trauma release rituals.  
  → *Simulations:* Heart–brain–geomagnetic coupling models.

- **[Media](media.md)**  
  The symbolic field is as real as the electromagnetic one. Media can amplify coherence — or fragment it.  
  → *Case studies:* global meditation experiments, synchronized broadcasts, disinfo disruption.  
  → *Simulations:* Network contagion and coherence resilience models.

## Civic Field

- These anchors interlock like oscillators in a network.  
- Rituals give rhythm, plazas give geometry, healing loops give care, media gives narrative.  
- Together they form the civic resonance infrastructure: **living cities tuned to Earth’s hum**.

## Next Steps

- Add **cross-links** to `docs/field/human.md` and `docs/field/earth.md` to show biophysical grounding.  
- Pull in **figures** from `sims/figures/` to visualize resonance in civic contexts.  
- Add **case libraries**: festivals, spaces, group healings, media events.  
- Prototype **Resonant City** as a simulation + design framework that integrates all civic anchors.
