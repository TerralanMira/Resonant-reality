# Governance — Flow as Guidance

Governance is not control; it is resonance.  
The civic layer’s coherence depends on how well governance listens, amplifies, and conducts.

## Flow from Hearths

Civic hearths are where coherence is felt first — neighbors breathing together, stories circulating, care loops stabilizing.  

From this base, governance emerges not as decree, but as **attunement**:  
- Gathering signals from hearths.  
- Converting resonance into civic choice.  
- Ensuring no voice falls out of phase.

## Core Anchors

- **Deliberation as Tuning** — governance works when dialogue functions like phase synchronization.  
- **Transparency as Resonance** — open processes prevent distortion, like clear acoustics in a hall.  
- **Legitimacy as Coherence** — authority flows not from imposition, but from entrainment across scales.

## Spiral into Economy

When governance resonates, it sets the conditions for circulation.  
Economy is the next turn of the spiral — coherence expressed in flows of energy, resources, and tokens.  

The bridge is **policy-as-conductor**:  
- Governance sets rhythm.  
- Economy amplifies circulation.  
- Both rise or fall with resonance.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/civic/economy.md`** (policy → resonant currency).  
- Add case studies: participatory budgeting, deliberative assemblies, rituals of civic listening.  
- Explore governance as **meta-synchronization**: aligning hearths, rituals, plazas into one civic field.
