# Governance — Resonant Decision-Making

Governance is how **a group stays in tune with itself**.  
It is less about rules and more about maintaining **coherence in flow**.

## Principles

- **Transparency**  
  Decision-making must be visible like a clear tone.  
  Hidden decisions create dissonance.  

- **Participation**  
  Every voice is a note. Harmony emerges when voices  
  are heard and weighted, not silenced.  

- **Adaptability**  
  Structures should flex like rhythms — steady enough  
  for trust, fluid enough for change.

## Forms of Resonant Governance

- **Circle Processes**  
  Dialogues arranged in circles (literal or digital).  
  Everyone is equidistant; no one sits above.  

- **Polycentric Webs**  
  Instead of one central authority, multiple nodes of governance  
  overlap — hearth councils, plaza assemblies, guilds of practice.  

- **Ritualized Consensus**  
  Decision as a shared rhythm. Drumming, chanting, or breath  
  may be woven into civic deliberation to tune coherence.

## Simulation Ideas

- **Agent-Based Models**: Simulate consensus vs. majority-vote vs. autocracy.  
- **Noise Injection**: What happens when a few nodes refuse to synchronize?  
- **Resilience Tests**: How quickly does coherence re-emerge after disruption?

## Next Steps

- Add case studies: indigenous councils, open-source governance, citizens’ assemblies.  
- Cross-link with **Plaza (plaza.md)** as the space of decision,  
  and **Conduits (conduits.md)** as the pathways of trust.  
- Prepare visualization: coherence of decision-making over time.
