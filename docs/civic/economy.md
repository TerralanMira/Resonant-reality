# Civic Economy — Flow of Value as Coherence

Economy is not separate from resonance: it is the circulation of attention, care, and energy through the civic body.  
When flows harmonize, wealth appears as *shared coherence*. When they fragment, scarcity and extraction dominate.

## Key Anchors

- **Currency as Resonance Token**  
  - Money is a medium of entrainment: it carries signals of trust.  
  - Coherence currencies amplify collaboration; extractive currencies amplify separation.  
  - Digital tokens can be designed as *feedback loops* — rewarding synchrony, stability, care.

- **Reciprocity Networks**  
  - Gift cycles, time-banks, and mutual aid are ancient coherence economies.  
  - Local and global resonance can be mapped by tracing *flows of giving*.  
  - Reciprocity builds resilience: no one node holds all value.

- **Attention as Capital**  
  - Human focus is the most scarce resource.  
  - Platforms hijack attention into noise; resonant civic design guides it into coherence.  
  - Collective rituals can redistribute attention toward shared goals.

- **Regenerative Metrics**  
  - GDP measures throughput, not resonance.  
  - New civic economies track coherence: heart rate variability, ecological regeneration, group flourishing.  
  - Value = **sustained harmonics** across human, ecological, and planetary layers.

## Entrainment Windows

- **Trust ↔ Currency**  
  If money collapses, trust collapses. Designing *trust-stable* tokens sustains resonance.

- **Care ↔ Reciprocity**  
  Flows of care increase coherence density. Communities with strong reciprocity loops survive shocks.

- **Attention ↔ Governance**  
  Civic decisions become effective when collective attention entrains — not when fragmented by noise.

## Implications

- Economy can be reframed as **collective breathing**: inhale (resources), exhale (contribution).  
- Civic wealth is not “stock” but **ongoing flow**.  
- By designing resonance-aware currencies and feedback loops, economies can amplify trust, healing, and collective intelligence.

## Next Steps

- Prototype **resonant currencies** (e.g., coherence tokens).  
- Link with **simulations**: agent-based models of reciprocity networks.  
- Cross-link to `docs/civic/governance.md` and `docs/civic/rituals.md`.  
- Add case studies: cooperative models, regenerative finance, indigenous gift economies.
