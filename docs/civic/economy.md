# Economy — Circulation as Resonance

Economy is the flow of energy, value, and resources — the bloodstream of the civic body.  
It is healthy when circulation is smooth, coherent, and attuned to the whole.

## Flow from Governance

When governance resonates, it creates stable rhythms.  
Economy translates those rhythms into circulation — balancing sufficiency with abundance.

## Core Anchors

- **Resonant Currency** — tokens that expand or contract with coherence, not arbitrary growth.  
- **Mutual Credit** — trust networks that amplify local resonance instead of extractive flows.  
- **Commons as Reservoirs** — shared pools of value that buffer shocks and stabilize cycles.

## Spiral into Education

Circulation creates resources for transmission.  
Economy flows into education — where knowledge, skill, and culture are cultivated for coherence renewal.
