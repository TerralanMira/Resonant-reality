# Civic Economy — Resonant Currency

Economy is resonance measured in tokens.  
A resonant economy doesn’t just move goods — it amplifies coherence.  
Currency becomes a civic conductor: expanding when collective rhythm is strong,  
contracting when noise threatens stability.  

---

## Core Idea: Policy as Conductor

- **Supply and demand** are not enemies but dancers in resonance.  
- When coherence (C) is high, issuance expands to reward contribution.  
- When price drifts, contraction reins it back toward balance.  
- The economy becomes a feedback instrument tuned to civic harmony.

Run it:

```bash
python sims/resonant_currency.py
python sims/resonant_currency.py --T 600 --agents 400 --alpha 0.08 --beta 0.06 --seed 7
	•	Interpretation:
	•	Price ~ 1.0 = tuned instrument
	•	Expanding supply = abundance in coherence
	•	Contracting supply = stability in turbulence

⸻

Civic Implications
	•	Incentive Design: Reward contribution to coherence, not just extraction.
	•	Stability: Feedback loop keeps value anchored near 1.0.
	•	Scaling: Small communities can test currencies tuned to their rhythms.
	•	Policy: Shifts from external control → participatory resonance.

⸻

Civic Design Principles
	•	Treat monetary policy as an instrument, not a lever.
	•	Anchor issuance to coherence signals (HRV, participation, geomagnetic calm).
	•	Use transparency: show graphs of supply, price, coherence in civic halls.
	•	Experiment in sandboxes before scaling to city-wide economies.

Next Steps
	•	Cross-link with docs/sims/resonant_currency.md for full model notes.
	•	Collect case studies: community currencies, time banks, cooperative credit.
	•	Explore: Can a global resonant currency stabilize planetary turbulence?
