# Resonant Economy

The economy is not just trade — it is the flow of energy, matter, and meaning.  
When tuned to resonance, it shifts from extraction and competition  
toward balance, reciprocity, and regenerative cycles.

## Anchors

- **Reciprocity Circles**  
  Exchanges framed not in currency alone, but in cycles of giving and returning.  
  → Inspired by Indigenous gift economies and mutual aid networks.  
  → Anchors community trust, resilience, and non-monetary wealth.

- **Commons Stewardship**  
  Resources (land, water, airwaves, digital knowledge) as shared inheritance.  
  → Governed collectively, regenerated before extracted.  
  → Resonant principle: flows must return to the field that sustains them.

- **Local–Global Resonance**  
  Small-scale, resilient economies linked in fractal patterns.  
  → Each neighborhood can sustain basics, while connected globally through exchange.  
  → Avoids both isolation and dependency.

## Design Patterns

- **Circular Flows**  
  Waste → input for new cycles.  
  Resonant cities design metabolism like ecosystems, with no “outside.”

- **Timebanking & Mutual Credit**  
  Hours, skills, and care labor valued equally with financial capital.  
  → Creates a substrate of trust, reducing reliance on debt-money.

- **Resonant Currency**  
  Local currencies or digital tokens pegged to ecological / social health metrics.  
  → Value rises with collective coherence, not speculation.

- **Civic Dividend**  
  Surpluses from commons (energy, land rents, knowledge licensing) redistributed directly to citizens.  
  → Reframes prosperity as shared resonance, not private hoarding.

## Implications

- Economic activity can be reframed as a *tuning practice* —  
  adjusting flows to avoid dissonance, amplify coherence, and regenerate sources.  
- Crises (inflation, scarcity, inequality) often reveal blocked or distorted flows.  
  Resonant framing emphasizes restoring balance, not imposing scarcity.

## Next Steps

- Link to **`docs/civic/governance.md`** (who decides stewardship).  
- Simulate resonant exchange using network flow models in **`sims/`**.  
- Document real-world pilots: community currencies, commons trusts, regenerative co-ops.
