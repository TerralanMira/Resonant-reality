# Civic Economy — Resonance as Currency

The economy is not an abstract ledger; it is the flow of resonance embodied.  
Trust, reciprocity, and shared rhythm are the real infrastructure beneath markets.  

When coherence rises — in community, ecology, or culture — value multiplies.  
When it collapses, no amount of tokens or credit can patch the decay.

## Anchors of a Resonant Economy

- **Trust as Currency**  
  Exchange is possible because trust reduces friction.  
  → Reputation, reliability, and shared rhythm are foundational capital.  

- **Flow as Wealth**  
  Wealth is not hoarded stock but circulating flow.  
  → Like blood in the body, circulation keeps systems alive.  

- **Equity as Resonance**  
  Resonance cannot exist if some are silenced.  
  → Inclusive structures create stable long-term growth.  

- **Resilience as Buffer**  
  Coherence requires adaptive slack.  
  → Reserves, commons, and mutual aid act as “dampers” against shocks.

## Currency as Conductor

Resonant economies require instruments tuned to coherence.  
Instead of fiat or extractive tokens, we imagine a **Resonant Currency**:

- Policy is not set top-down but responds dynamically to a **coherence index** (C ∈ [0,1]).  
- When coherence is high, issuance expands to reward contribution.  
- When coherence is low, policy prioritizes stability and contraction.  

This transforms money from a blunt exchange tool into a **conductor of resonance**.

## Simulation Bridge

We prototype this idea with a toy model:  
[`sims/resonant_currency.py`](../../sims/resonant_currency.py)

- Agents contribute more when coherence is high.  
- Supply adjusts with two levers:  
  - **α (alpha)**: expansion sensitivity to coherence.  
  - **β (beta)**: contraction sensitivity to price deviation.  
- Price is stabilized near 1.0 while allowing reward flows.  

Run it yourself:

```bash
python sims/resonant_currency.py
python sims/resonant_currency.py --T 600 --agents 400 --alpha 0.08 --beta 0.06 --seed 7
Outputs:
	•	sims/figures/resonant_currency_price.png — price vs. coherence.
	•	sims/figures/resonant_currency_supply.png — circulating supply.

Resonant Design Implications
	•	Micro ↔ Macro
The same way the heart entrains cells, currency policy entrains communities.
	•	Visible Feedback
Simulations provide dashboards where coherence becomes tangible —
allowing policy to be debated in resonance, not ideology.
	•	Collective Autonomy
Communities can fork their own “tuning” — adjusting α and β as cultural choice.
	•	Ecological Parallel
Just as ecosystems recycle nutrients, resonant currency recycles value.
Decay is not waste but compost for renewal.

Next Steps
	•	Add case studies: time-banks, mutual credit, indigenous gift economies.
	•	Extend the simulation: multi-community interaction, shocks, policy diversity.
	•	Cross-link with docs/sims/resonant_currency.md for deeper math notes.
	•	Tie into governance docs — how policy levers are set and adjusted.
