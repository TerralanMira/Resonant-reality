# Conduits — Resonant Pathways

If **hearths** are the micro-scale and **plazas** are the meso-scale,  
**conduits** are the **pathways between them**.  
They are the arteries where resonance **moves, amplifies, and carries**.

## Principles

- **Connectivity**  
  Conduits **link hearths to plazas**, plazas to institutions, and people to places.  

- **Flow**  
  Information, emotion, and energy travel along these channels.  
  They can be **physical** (streets, rivers, broadband) or **cultural** (rituals, memes, songs).  

- **Resonance**  
  A well-tuned conduit carries coherence without distortion.  
  A broken conduit breeds noise, mistrust, or blockage.

## Functions

- **Circulation**  
  Just as blood vessels sustain the body, conduits sustain civic life.  

- **Amplification**  
  A story told in one hearth can ripple through conduits into a citywide myth.  

- **Resilience**  
  Multiple conduits prevent collapse — if one fails, others can carry the flow.

## Simulation Ideas

- **Network Models**: Nodes as hearths/plazas, edges as conduits.  
- **Flow Mapping**: Visualize trust, rumor, or coherence spreading through networks.  
- **Interference Tests**: Simulate what happens when conduits are noisy or blocked.

## Next Steps

- Add diagrams of conduits: roads, rivers, fiber, songlines.  
- Link to **Hearths (hearths.md)** and **Plaza (plaza.md)** for the fractal triad.  
- Extend into **Conductor Layer**: how civic conduits connect to field-level flows.
