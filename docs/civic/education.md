# Education — Transmission of Resonance

Education is how coherence is renewed across generations.  
It tunes perception, skill, and imagination to civic rhythms.

## Flow from Economy

When circulation is resonant, education flourishes — resourced to explore, transmit, and adapt.  
Knowledge becomes not a commodity, but a shared resonance field.

## Core Anchors

- **Embodied Learning** — teaching not just concepts, but rhythms (breath, song, craft).  
- **Collective Inquiry** — classrooms as micro-fields of coherence.  
- **Transmission as Ritual** — graduation, apprenticeship, storytelling as phase-passing.

## Spiral into Plazas

Education expands individuals into citizens.  
Its resonance gathers in public plazas — where learning turns to deliberation and visibility.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/civic/plazas.md`**.  
- Add case studies: forest schools, peer-to-peer academies, civic science labs.  
- Link education rhythms to simulations (learning curves as entrainment processes).
