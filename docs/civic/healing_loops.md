# Healing Loops

Healing is not private. It is civic.  
Communities that lack feedback and renewal spiral into noise.  
Healing loops are structures — ritual, policy, tech — that restore balance.  

---

## Anchors

- **Public Health Feedback**  
  - Dashboards that reveal stress/coherence in real-time.  
  - Not punitive, but restorative.  

- **Conflict Resolution Rituals**  
  - Circle dialogues, truth commissions, restorative justice.  
  - Coherence rebuilt through structured ritual.  

- **Community Renewal**  
  - Seasonal clean-ups, rebuilding days, civic festivals.  
  - Renewal cycles woven into the calendar.  

---

## Functions

- Detect where coherence breaks.  
- Provide pathways for restoration.  
- Keep the civic nervous system **elastic, not brittle**.  

---

## Implications

Healing loops make stress survivable.  
Without them, systems snap.  
With them, cities learn and regenerate.

## Next Steps

- Prototype: civic dashboards tied to HRV/geomagnetic data.  
- Collect rituals of reconciliation from diverse cultures.  
- Simulate: models of resilience with and without feedback loops.
