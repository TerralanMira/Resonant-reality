# Healing Loops

Healing is civic technology.  
Loops prevent stress from accumulating into collapse.

## Case Studies

- **South Africa Truth & Reconciliation Commission**  
  - Ritualized testimony as coherence restoration.  
  - Collective catharsis prevents revenge cycles.  

- **Ubuntu Circles (East Africa)**  
  - Community dialogue circles, guided by elders.  
  - HRV coherence measured in participants.  

- **Japanese Tsunami Renewal Festivals**  
  - Annual rebuilding festivals to ritually release trauma.  
  - Civic renewal embedded in ritual cycle.

## Data Anchors

- HRV variability as a stress/resonance proxy.  
- Epidemiological data: communities with reconciliation rituals recover faster.  
- Social network analysis: restorative practices shorten “conflict half-life.”  

---

## Design Principles

- Make **repair visible**.  
- Use **ritual rhythm** to anchor renewal.  
- Close loops regularly — avoid long buildup of stress.

## Simulation Pathways

- Dynamic resilience modeling: cities with vs without healing loops.  
- Stress–release cycles modeled as oscillators.  
- Impact of healing frequency on systemic collapse probability.
