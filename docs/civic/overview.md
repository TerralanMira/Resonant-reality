# Resonant City — Civic Overview

A city is not just buildings and roads — it is a **living instrument**.  
When tuned, it sustains coherence across human, natural, and cosmic layers.  
When untuned, it fragments, drains, and destabilizes.

## The Civic Orchestra

- **Plaza (Heart)**  
  - Central node where rhythms converge.  
  - Collective rituals, gatherings, and festivals set the pulse.  

- **Conductor (Flow)**  
  - Roads, waterways, and communication loops.  
  - Channels resonance through circulation — like blood or breath.  

- **Neighborhoods (Cells)**  
  - Local hearths, gardens, and workshops.  
  - Each tuned to a frequency but linked into larger coherence.  

- **Cosmic Alignments**  
  - Streets, towers, and nodes aligned with solar, lunar, and stellar markers.  
  - City breathes in time with the cosmos.

## Nested Layers

- **Human ↔ Civic ↔ Planetary ↔ Cosmic**  
  - Individual practices → neighborhood coherence → city resonance → planetary alignment.  
  - Each scale is a harmonic of the greater whole.  

- **Feedback Loops**  
  - Festivals, chants, bells, and public art anchor shared rhythms.  
  - Resonance spirals outward and returns amplified.

## Historical Anchors

- **Teotihuacan** — aligned to Venus cycles, city as cosmic mirror.  
- **Athens Agora** — plaza as civic heart and philosophical hearth.  
- **Jerusalem** — sacred center radiating global coherence.

## Implications

- Civic design is not neutral — it is **resonant architecture**.  
- Cities can be disease or medicine depending on their tuning.  
- Future design must harmonize **flow, heart, and cosmic direction**.

  - `docs/civic/conductor.md` (flow).  
  - `docs/human/index.md` (body ↔ city resonance).  
  - `docs/field/earth/index.md` (city ↔ planetary grid).  

- Add visuals:  
  - Blueprint: city as orchestra (heart, flow, cells, alignments).  
  - Spiral diagram: nested resonance from hearth to cosmos.
