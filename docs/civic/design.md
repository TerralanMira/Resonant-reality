# Civic Design — Resonant Architecture

Civic design is how resonance becomes tangible in stone, wood, glass, and light.  
The city itself can be tuned as an instrument for coherence.

## Design Principles

- **Geometry as Tuning Fork**  
  - Circles, spirals, and golden-ratio proportions  
  - Sacred geometry aligns with human nervous systems  
  - Civic spaces shaped as resonant chambers  

- **Acoustic & Light Fields**  
  - Domes, amphitheaters, and reflective surfaces  
  - Natural reverberation fosters shared voice and song  
  - Sunlight, firelight, and candlelight anchor circadian rhythms  

- **Porosity & Flow**  
  - Open plazas for gatherings  
  - Thresholds marking transitions between states  
  - Movement designed as ritual pathways

## Hearth-Centered Layouts

- **Neighborhood Hearths**  
  Small-scale resonant nodes for daily life  
  → circles, kitchens, firepits, meditation rooms  

- **Civic Plazas**  
  Medium-scale nodes for festivals, councils, rituals  
  → stages, circles, trees, altars, fountains  

- **Regional Sanctuaries**  
  Large-scale coherence hubs  
  → temples, amphitheaters, landscapes aligned to solstices/equinoxes

## Healing Through Space

- **Ritual Architecture**  
  Spaces that invite ceremony and collective coherence  
  → drum circles, chanting halls, labyrinth paths  

- **Restorative Urbanism**  
  Green corridors as breathing lungs of the city  
  Flowing water features as circulation systems  
  Quiet sanctuaries within noisy grids  

- **Trauma-Informed Design**  
  Architecture that soothes dysregulated nervous systems  
  → soft materials, curved lines, natural light, sensory grounding

## Simulation Ideas

- **Resonant Chamber Models**  
  How geometry amplifies sound and coherence waves  

- **Urban Flow Mapping**  
  Model citizen movement like blood circulation — identify blockages and open flow  

- **Light / Shadow Dynamics**  
  Simulate sunlight and firelight rhythms across civic gatherings

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/civic/hearths.md`** and **`docs/civic/rituals.md`**.  
- Add diagrams of resonant city layouts (spirals, mandalas, grids).  
- Prototype civic plaza simulation in `/sims/civic_design/`.
