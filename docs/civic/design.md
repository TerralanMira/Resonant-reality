# Civic Design — Spaces that Resonate

Design is not just functional — it is **acoustic, symbolic, and relational**.  
A well-shaped civic space can amplify coherence like a resonant chamber.

## Core Patterns

- **Circles and Spirals**  
  Geometry shapes flow. Circular plazas and spiral walkways  
  create centers without edges, movement without dead ends.  

- **Thresholds**  
  Entrances act as tuning forks — portals where the individual  
  shifts into collective awareness.  

- **Nested Scales**  
  Small hearths feed into plazas, plazas into civic centers,  
  centers into city-scale webs. Micro mirrors macro.

## Resonant Materials

- **Stone**  
  Holds vibration; anchors memory.  
  Used in hearths, monuments, grounding structures.  

- **Wood**  
  Warm, flexible, responsive. Ideal for gathering spaces.  

- **Water & Air**  
  Moving elements woven into design — fountains, wind corridors,  
  open plazas that breathe with climate.  

- **Light**  
  Sun paths, moon phases, and celestial alignments  
  embedded into architecture.

## Dynamics of Flow

- **Concentric Seating**  
  People arranged to face one another, reducing hierarchy.  

- **Sound Chambers**  
  Domes, amphitheaters, or acoustic shells that allow  
  voices, chants, and music to circulate naturally.  

- **Green Corridors**  
  Living pathways that connect hearths, plazas, and civic centers.

## Simulation Ideas

- **Acoustic Mapping**: Model how sound travels through different geometries.  
- **Flow of Movement**: Agent-based simulations of plaza gatherings.  
- **Light Resonance**: Track how solstice/equinox alignments shape civic rhythm.

## Next Steps

- Add design sketches (spirals, domes, hearths) into `/figures/`.  
- Cross-link to **Hearths (hearths.md)** and **Plaza (plaza.md)**.  
- Expand into **Resonant City layer**: scaling civic design principles to the urban web.
