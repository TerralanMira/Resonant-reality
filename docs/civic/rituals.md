# Civic Rituals

Ritual is civic resonance made visible.  
Through rhythm, chant, procession, or shared silence, people entrain to each other —  
aligning heartbeats, breath, and attention into spirals of coherence.  
Rituals are not extras to governance, they are the *tuning events* of civic life.

## Core Idea: Spiral Resonance

- **Spirals** capture the micro → macro → micro recursion of ritual.  
- Each participant contributes a cycle (breath, clap, chant).  
- The cycles interlock, spiraling outward into shared rhythm.  
- The form scales fractally: a small circle, a plaza, a nation, a planet.

This is modeled in the **Spiral Resonance simulation**.

## Simulation Anchor

See **[`sims/spiral_resonance.py`](../../sims/spiral_resonance.py)**.

- **What it shows**: A spiral of oscillators visually converging to resonance.  
- **Output**: `sims/figures/spiral.png` (animated if run interactively).  
- **Interpretation**: Disorder at the edges → coherence at the core.  
  This is the “hum” of ritual.

Run it yourself:

```bash
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
Ritual Implications
	•	Tuning: Ritual opens civic space with coherence, like tuning an instrument.
	•	Inclusivity: Everyone can contribute a beat, a step, a breath.
	•	Scaling: Small rituals spiral into city-wide coherence.
	•	Healing: Shared rhythm stabilizes stress and trauma in the field.

Civic Design Principles
	•	Begin assemblies with shared rhythm (drumming, breath, chant).
	•	Design plazas and halls to amplify sound and rhythm into spirals.
	•	Use seasonal rituals to anchor civic cycles (solstice, harvest, equinox).
	•	Rituals are interfaces where the invisible coherence becomes visible.

Next Steps
	•	Cross-link with docs/sims/spiral_resonance.md (explanation of the sim).
	•	Collect examples: powwows, cathedral chants, protest marches, haka.
	•	Develop metrics: measure group HRV or brainwave coherence during ritual.
