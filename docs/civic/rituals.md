# Civic Rituals — Weaving Coherence

Rituals are how communities rehearse resonance together.  
They are the pulse of civic life, turning architecture into lived coherence.

## Core Functions of Ritual

- **Alignment**  
  - Syncing hearts, breath, and movement  
  - Generating shared temporal rhythm (weekly, seasonal, annual cycles)  

- **Memory**  
  - Encoding collective values into embodied practice  
  - Reinforcing myth and story through repetition  

- **Regulation**  
  - Soothing nervous systems and resolving tension  
  - Offering predictable containers for grief, joy, and transition

## Ritual Scales

- **Personal Practice**  
  Meditation, journaling, breathwork, song  
  ↳ anchors individual resonance  

- **Household & Hearth**  
  Shared meals, fire circles, bedtime songs  
  ↳ micro-coherence units  

- **Neighborhood & Civic Plazas**  
  Festivals, dances, parades, councils  
  ↳ meso-scale resonance amplification  

- **Regional & Global Synchrony**  
  Solstice ceremonies, synchronized meditations, mass chanting  
  ↳ macro-scale entrainment

## Ritual Technologies

- **Sound**  
  Drumming, chanting, bells, silence  
  ↳ entrains collective breath and heart  

- **Movement**  
  Circle dances, labyrinth walking, synchronized gestures  
  ↳ aligns kinesthetic fields  

- **Offerings & Symbols**  
  Altars, flowers, shared meals, fire  
  ↳ material anchors of the sacred  

- **Story & Myth**  
  Storytelling, theater, procession  
  ↳ carries cultural coherence forward

## Healing Loops

- **Grief Rituals**  
  Safe containers for mourning and release  
  → keeps trauma from fracturing community resonance  

- **Celebration Rituals**  
  Festivals and dances that raise collective frequency  
  → joy as coherence fuel  

- **Reconciliation Rituals**  
  Circles for apology, forgiveness, repair  
  → prevents civic “scar tissue”

## Simulation Ideas

- **Group Coherence Model**  
  Model how synchronized movement and breath amplify resonance  

- **Festival Dynamics**  
  Simulate how a festival propagates coherence through a city grid  

- **Entrainment Windows**  
  Compare ritual rhythm bands (drumming, chanting) with Schumann & brainwave frequencies

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/civic/hearths.md`**, **`docs/civic/loops.md`**, and **`docs/civic/design.md`**.  
- Add ethnographic examples (e.g., potlatch, powwow, solstice festival).  
- Prototype **ritual entrainment sim** in `/sims/civic_rituals/`.
