# Rituals — Stabilizers of Coherence

Rituals are where resonance is formalized, repeated, and stabilized.  
They bind the civic field across generations.

## Flow from Plazas

Plazas test resonance in the open.  
Rituals take those signals and **engrave them in time** — anchoring civic memory.

## Core Anchors

- **Calendrical Resonance** — seasonal festivals aligning human and Earth cycles.  
- **Civic Rites** — inaugurations, oaths, processions as coherence transfer.  
- **Micro-rituals** — handshakes, greetings, shared silences stabilizing daily coherence.

## Spiral into Hearths

The spiral closes at the hearth.  
Rituals seed coherence back into intimate spaces — completing the civic helix.
