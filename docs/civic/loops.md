# Healing & Coherence Loops — Civic Layer

Loops are the circulatory system of civic life.  
They carry resonance, distribute healing, and return vitality.

## Core Dynamics

- **Exchange Loops**  
  Giving and receiving creates balanced flow.  
  Civic health depends on circulation, not hoarding.  

- **Witness Loops**  
  To be seen and to see others closes a circuit.  
  Recognition restores coherence after rupture.  

- **Grief & Renewal Loops**  
  Collective grief rituals metabolize loss.  
  Renewal ceremonies transform pain into shared strength.

## Hearths as Nodes

- **Local Anchors**  
  Each hearth is a capacitor of coherence.  
  Hearths feed loops with embodied trust and continuity.  

- **Nested Scales**  
  Hearth → Neighborhood → City → Region  
  Loops braid across levels like vascular networks.  

- **Adaptive Mesh**  
  When one hearth falters, others carry the load.  
  Civic coherence emerges from redundancy.

## Healing Technologies

- **Resonant Dialogue**  
  Structured circles for listening and response.  
  Words as tuning forks for collective frequency.  

- **Embodied Practices**  
  Co-breathing, synchronized movement, shared silence.  
  Healing is enacted as resonance.  

- **Feedback Signals**  
  Loops generate measurable coherence.  
  HRV monitors, sound maps, and citizen sensing  
  make invisible resonance visible.

## Simulation Ideas

- **Network Resilience Models**  
  How many hearths need to stay coherent for a city to remain stable?  

- **Loop Amplification Dynamics**  
  When do local loops tip into city-wide coherence?  

- **Shock Absorption Tests**  
  Model how grief or disruption can be metabolized without collapse.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/civic/rituals.md`** and **`docs/civic/design.md`**.  
- Add case studies of healing circles, reconciliation councils, and grief rituals.  
- Run simulations in `/sims/civic_loops/` to test resilience patterns.
