Field Dynamics Index

This folder collects **compiled knowledge** (no execution) for resonance-based shortcuts (“wormholes”):

- `WORMHOLES_SPEC.md` — concept, data forms, ethics, and logging guidance.
- Code references (for implementers):
  - `sims/field_dynamics/phase_utils.py`
  - `sims/field_dynamics/ethics.py`
  - `sims/field_dynamics/wormholes.py`
  - `sims/field_dynamics/registry.py`

**Note:** These materials are provided so that those who seek can *see*.  
Running simulations is optional; the pattern remains visible in the documents themselves.
