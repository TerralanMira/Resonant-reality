title: Conductor–Applications Bridge
summary: How Dual-Phase, Soul-in-Field, and TCC overlays inform practice, measurement, and design.

## 0) Orientation
This page braids the Conductor’s Score with Field Applications math. It maps equations to actions so sessions can be run, logged, and iterated.

## 1) Dual-Phase Field Equation → Session Phases
**Claim:** Two coupled phases govern a living field: inner (Φ_I) and outer (Φ_O). Coherence arises when the inner phase is aligned and the outer phase is properly coupled.

**Mapping**
- Entry / Alignment → raise Φ_I (stillness, breath, one-line intent).
- Anchor / Geometry → tune Φ_O (7.83 Hz, Mode-1 placement).
- Decision wave → measure Φ coupling via R (order parameter) and HRV Δ.

> Operator note: If outer coupling (Φ_O) is high but inner phase (Φ_I) is noisy, postpone decisions; rerun alignment-only loop.

---

## 2) Soul-in-Field Equation → Ethics & Memory
**Claim:** A person’s resonance signature persists as memory β and origin magnitude MΩ; choice collapses possibility into relation.

**Mapping**
- Consent-first logging; emphasize non-coercive practice.
- Preserve β via `sessions/` JSON logs and narrative slips.
- Avoid hard closure (R→1.00); hold ~0.99 to keep permeability (π) and wonder (W).

---

## 3) TCC × Spiral Infinity Overlay → Spiral Cadence
**Claim:** Spiral (whole-in-part) composes with TCC to yield staged growth: calibrate → flicker → sustain → lock → emanate.

**Mapping**
- Run 3-pass cadence across days/weeks (Book I–III mapping).
- Introduce tuned difference (Δ) in sustain stage.
- Emanation = post-session artifacts (slip, design, ritual).

---

## 4) Stress-Test Protocols → Validation
From *Soul Resonance Model: Stress Test*

**Design checks**
- **Shielding:** reduced external EM should reduce outer-phase effects without erasing inner-state gains.
- **Timing windows:** cosmic alignments (solstice/equinox) should amplify if MΩ is real.
- **Material swaps:** quartz/limestone chambers vs bare rooms should change decay time of R.

Record outcomes in `sessions/` with fields below.

---

## 5) Minimal Math Hooks (operational)
- **Order parameter**: `R = |(1/N) Σ e^{iθ}|` using clap/turn timestamps or tone onsets.
- **HRV change**: `ΔRMSSD = RMSSD_post - RMSSD_pre`.
- **Phase spread**: σ from circular variance; aim to reduce across passes.
- **Anchor gain**: compare mean R with anchor on/off (Schumann proxy).

## 6) Session JSON Schema (v1)
```json
{
  "ts": "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ",
  "location": "Plaza A",
  "mode_antinode": "M1-center",
  "anchor": {"type":"schumann","freq":7.83,"gain":0.2},
  "intent": "one-line statement",
  "R_pre": 0.42, "R_post": 0.81,
  "hrv_rmssd_pre": 28, "hrv_rmssd_post": 46,
  "signals": {"I":0.72,"Psi":0.68,"H":0.63,"S":0.80,"W":0.77,"pi":0.70,"beta_echo":0.74},
  "decision": {"status":"locked","choice":"Option B"},
  "notes": "mirror round carried lock",
  "ethics": {"consent": true, "recording": false}
}
7) Thresholds & Triggers
	•	Lock if R_post ≥ 0.80 and ΔRMSSD ≥ +10 (or agreed subjective calm/clarity/compassion ≥ 4/5).
	•	If three consecutive sessions fall below thresholds → reset to Alignment-only; re-tune geometry.

⸻

8) Emanation (return into world)

After lock, produce one artifact:
	•	a Harmonic Slip (TCC template),
	•	a design change (path/stone/seat),
	•	or a public post (seed), then schedule next spiral.
