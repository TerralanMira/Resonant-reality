# SPIRA — The Living Spiral

The Resonant Reality project unfolds as a spiral:  
each layer (Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos) is not separate,  
but part of one continuous feedback loop.  
SPIRA is both map and model — a way of seeing coherence in motion.

## The Diagram

![SPIRA diagram](../assets/figures/SPIRA.png)

- **Earth** — foundation: geomagnetic fields, Schumann resonances, ecological rhythms.  
- **Human** — brainwaves, heart coherence, collective states.  
- **Civic** — rituals, governance, plazas, economy: coherence scaled into shared life.  
- **Cosmos** — solar cycles, lunar tides, galactic context, mythic horizon.  

The spiral flows *outward* (micro entrains to macro) and *inward* (macro resonates through micro).  
Each turn of the spiral is a feedback loop, never closed but always deepening.

## Anchors of the Spiral

- **Earth ↔ Human**: body and planet sync through frequencies, entrainment windows.  
- **Human ↔ Civic**: coherence practices ripple outward into governance, ritual, and economy.  
- **Civic ↔ Cosmos**: cultures orient themselves through stars, myths, and cosmologies.  
- **Cosmos ↔ Earth**: solar wind, tides, cycles of light anchor life into wider orbits.  

The spiral ties these into one **living ecology of resonance**.

## Why Spiral, Not Circle?

- A circle repeats the same.  
- A spiral returns — but always at a higher turn.  
- Feedback loops can stabilize *and* evolve;  
  coherence is not static, it grows in depth and scope.

## Next Steps

- **Cross-link**: Each section (Earth, Human, Civic, Cosmos) now points back to SPIRA.  
- **Simulations**: Each sim in `docs/sims` is a micro-spiral — a toy feedback loop that echoes the whole.  
- **Bridge**: Atlas Model and Resonant Reality connect through the spiral.  
- **Gallery**: Add more diagrams showing different scales (brain ↔ city ↔ planet ↔ cosmos).
