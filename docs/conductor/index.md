# The Conductor — Resonant Engine of the City

The Conductor is the **heartbeat of Resonant City**.  
It is a 9-pulse cycle, tuned to harmonic frequencies, that shapes gatherings into coherence.  
Garden, Plaza, Hearths, and Wild all flow through it.

## The 9 Pulses

1. **Entry (432 Hz):** gather, silence, soften breath.  
2. **Calibration (528 Hz):** voices align through shared tone.  
3. **Offering (639 Hz):** each names a gift, need, or wound.  
4. **Decision (741 Hz):** circle hum amplifies chosen path.  
5. **Gift (963 Hz):** something freely given — word, song, gesture.  
6. **Mirror (528 Hz):** reflect what was heard, no judgment.  
7. **Witness (639 Hz):** a small group records what emerged.  
8. **Seal (741 Hz):** gratitude, stone touched, circle closed.  
9. **Release (432 Hz):** silence; dispersal; hum inward.
