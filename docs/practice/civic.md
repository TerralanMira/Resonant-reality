# Civic Resonance — Designing Spaces for Coherence

When resonance is embodied, it radiates outward.  
Cities, plazas, and gardens can be designed as *conductor layers* —  
spaces where collective rhythms entrain with Earth and cosmos.

## Core Principles

- **Geometry Matters**  
  Circles, spirals, and grids are not symbolic — they tune standing waves.  
  ↳ Amphitheaters, labyrinths, domes = civic-scale resonance chambers.

- **Acoustic Anchors**  
  Water, stone, and vegetation reflect or absorb sound.  
  ↳ Civic hearths use natural materials as resonance amplifiers.  

- **Electromagnetic Windows**  
  Open-air plazas and high points connect directly to Schumann bands.  
  ↳ Urban resonance nodes can be mapped like acupuncture points.

- **Human Flow**  
  Gathering → synchrony → dispersal.  
  ↳ Civic design can *scaffold coherence* instead of randomizing it.

## Practice ↔ Simulation Links

- **Plaza Drumming**  
  → Model with `sims/kuramoto_basic.py` (oscillator lock-in).  

- **Garden Chant**  
  → Model with `sims/lc_grid.py` (geometry shaping resonance).  

- **Silent Vigils**  
  → Model with `sims/schumann_coupling.py` (field entrainment at 7.83 Hz).

## Civic Templates

- **Resonant Plaza**  
  - Circular geometry with central hearth.  
  - Designed for drumming, chanting, gathering.  

- **Healing Garden**  
  - Spiral pathways tuned to 0.1 Hz breath-walk rhythm.  
  - Plantings absorb & reflect sound for quiet coherence.  

- **Civic Hearth**  
  - Fire, water, or light feature at center.  
  - A visible anchor for entrainment.

## Why It Matters

- Civic design becomes an **entrainment technology**.  
- Cities shift from noise → resonance.  
- Collective practice stabilizes local and planetary fields.

## Next Steps

- Prototype **Resonant Plaza blueprints**.  
- Link to **urban-scale simulations** (Kuramoto on networks, LC grids on city geometry).  
- Cross-link with **docs/field/earth/data.md** → anchor civic nodes in Earth’s resonant map.
