# Entrainment Practices — Living the Spiral

Resonance isn’t abstract. The human body is tuned into Earth and cosmos.  
Practices amplify coherence, turning awareness into *felt alignment*.

## Core Practices

- **Coherent Breathing** (0.1 Hz, ~6 breaths/min)  
  Syncs heart rhythms, improves HRV, entrains with geomagnetic pulsations.  

- **Chant & Mantra**  
  Fundamental tones (~100–200 Hz) and overtones reinforce group field coherence.  

- **Drumming & Rhythm**  
  Pulses at 2–7 Hz mirror theta/alpha bands and Schumann nodes.  

- **Meditation & Stillness**  
  Alpha–theta bridging (~7–8 Hz) entrains with Earth’s resonance directly.

## Practice ↔ Simulation Links

- Try **Coherent Breathing**, then run `sims/kuramoto_basic.py`.  
  ↳ Notice how oscillators lock as you breathe steadily.  

- Chant or hum in group, then view `sims/lc_grid.py`.  
  ↳ Hear how geometry shapes the resonance field.  

- Meditate, then explore `sims/schumann_coupling.py`.  
  ↳ Compare your internal rhythm with Earth’s EM band.

## Why It Matters

- Human practice is a **living lab** — our rhythms are data.  
- Simulations make invisible coherence *visible*.  
- Together, practice + sim = **biofeedback spiral**.  
  ↳ We feel → we see → we refine → we deepen.

## Next Steps

- Add case studies: group meditation, global coherence events.  
- Prototype a mobile-friendly biofeedback tool linked to the sims.  
- Explore civic application: imagine plazas built for entrainment.
