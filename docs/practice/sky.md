# Sky Practices — Living the Cosmic Rhythm

Cosmic cycles are not abstract.  
They flow into **breath, ritual, and community timing**.  
By re-engaging sky patterns, humans re-enter the field of resonance.

## Daily — Solar Cycle

- **Sunrise attunement**  
  - Face east, breathe slowly as the sun rises.  
  - Anchor circadian rhythm, reset melatonin/cortisol balance.  

- **Solar pause (noon)**  
  - One minute of stillness under the sky.  
  - Practice “vertical coherence” — human as antenna between Earth ↔ Sun.  

- **Sunset reflection**  
  - Journal one line as the sun sets.  
  - Micro-ritual of closure → continuity.

## Monthly — Lunar Cycle

- **New Moon** → Intention  
  - Sit in silence, write what seeds to plant this cycle.  

- **First Quarter** → Action  
  - Commit to one visible step.  

- **Full Moon** → Illumination  
  - Gather with others: chant, meditate, or drum.  
  - Amplifies group coherence and reflects cosmic fullness.  

- **Last Quarter** → Release  
  - Journal what no longer serves.  
  - Aligns with waning energy, prepares for reset.

## Seasonal — Solar Gates

- **Equinox (balance)**  
  - Day = night.  
  - Practice: group circle, breath in synchrony, reflect on balance.  

- **Solstice (extremes)**  
  - Longest/shortest day.  
  - Practice: fasting, vigil, or sunrise watching.  
  - Amplifies resilience and renewal.

## Longer Waves — Planetary / Galactic

- **Venus cycles (584 days)**  
  - Track as morning/evening star.  
  - Practice: mark transitions with small offerings (flower, candle).  

- **Saturn returns (~29 years)**  
  - Collective rite of passage.  
  - Practice: write a letter to self, release old structures.  

- **Galactic alignment (≈26,000 years)**  
  - Mythic scale — embodied through story, art, and ritual re-enactment.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Sky journals** — log sun, moon, stars daily.  
- **Star apps / planetarium software** — modern tools for ancient literacy.  
- **Breath entrainment** — synchronize inhales/exhales with moon phases or sun cycle.  
- **Resonant group practice** — meditation or drumming at full moon / equinox.

## Why It Matters

- Re-connecting to sky rhythms restores **cosmic literacy**.  
- Practices anchor humans in **larger coherence patterns**.  
- Civic and cultural renewal begins when sky → human → city align again.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to:  
  - `docs/cosmos/alignments.md` (monumental sky–earth anchors).  
  - `docs/practice/breath.md` (micro-entrainment).  
  - `docs/civic/overview.md` (temple-city resonance).  

- Add diagrams:  
  - Solar/lunar cycles overlayed with human breath rhythms.  
  - Group practice “resonance wheel” calendar.
