# Human Layer — Body as Resonant Interface

**Claim:** the body houses consciousness as a resonant transceiver.
- Neural oscillations (θ/α/γ) couple to field carriers.
- Fascia/water lattice (χ) integrates charge over time.
- DNA helix acts as fractal antenna.
- Decoherence-as-renewal restores tuned coherence at edge thresholds.

```bash
python -m sims.human_layer_sim --steps 240
python -m sims.plot_human_layer
