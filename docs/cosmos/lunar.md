# Lunar Tides — The Moon’s Pull

The Moon is more than a satellite.  
It is a metronome of waters, rhythms, and emotions.

## Anchors

- **Tides** — oceanic rise/fall, twice daily  
- **Biological cycles** — menstruation, melatonin release  
- **Psychological states** — dream vividness, mood fluctuations  
- **Agricultural timing** — planting, harvesting rituals  

---

## Human Coupling

- Water in the body entrains with lunar tidal patterns.  
- Dream studies show increased recall near full moons.  
- Ancient calendars align ritual time with lunar phases.  

---

## Implications

- Lunar alignment can guide ritual design, agriculture, and collective rhythm.  
- Civic calendars could be re-synced with lunar beats,  
  reconnecting city flow with natural cycles.

## Next Steps

- Add case studies: full moon festivals, new moon rituals.  
- Simulation idea: “lunar coherence index” — HRV vs lunar phase.
