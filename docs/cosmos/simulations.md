# Cosmos Simulations

These models extend resonance beyond Earth and human scales, showing how cosmic cycles couple downward into ecological, physiological, and civic rhythms.

## Solar–Schumann Coupling

**What it shows**:  
How fluctuations in solar activity (sunspot cycles, flares) modulate Earth’s ionosphere and shift the Schumann resonance band near 7.83 Hz.

**Implementation idea**:  
- Extend the `sims/schumann_coupling.py` model.  
- Input: solar activity index (synthetic sine with noise, period ~11 years).  
- Output: slow modulation of Schumann frequency + coherence index.  

**Hypothesis**: Solar minima → more stable Schumann windows → easier meditation/entrainment.  
**Pass/Falsifier**: Compare modeled shifts against empirical EEG–Schumann correlations.

## Orbital Resonance Maps

**What it shows**:  
Planetary orbital ratios (e.g., Jupiter:Saturn 5:2) visualized as harmonic intervals.

**Implementation idea**:  
- Generate time-series of planetary positions.  
- Compute frequency ratios and visualize as spiral maps.  
- Highlight stable harmonic locks vs chaotic drifts.  

**Hypothesis**: Planetary harmonics echo into long-wave cultural/economic cycles.  
**Pass/Falsifier**: Test correlation with historical “long cycles” (e.g., Kondratiev waves).

## Cosmic ↔ Civic Calendar Dynamics

**What it shows**:  
How societies stabilize around shared cosmic rhythms (lunar months, solar years).

**Implementation idea**:  
- Agent-based model where agents align on ritual timing.  
- Shared calendar increases coherence; drift fragments civic order.  
- Model shows thresholds for synchrony.  

**Hypothesis**: Civic stability increases with accurate cosmic entrainment.  
**Pass/Falsifier**: Compare against historical disruptions during calendar shifts (e.g., Julian → Gregorian).

## Cross-Scale Coupling

**What it shows**:  
Feedback loop Cosmos → Earth → Human → Civic as a single spiral.  

**Implementation idea**:  
- Build meta-model linking solar index → Schumann frequency → HRV coherence → civic participation.  
- Each layer adds phase noise, but entrainment persists if coupling is strong.  

**Hypothesis**: Collective coherence rises when multiple scales align (e.g., festivals during geomagnetic calm).  
**Pass/Falsifier**: Cross-check against meditation/global coherence experiment data.

## Next Steps

- Code stubs into `sims/` (`solar_schumann.py`, `orbital_resonance.py`, `civic_calendar.py`).  
- Cross-link to **human resonance** (EEG, HRV) and **civic coherence** docs.  
- Add figures to `sims/figures/` as models mature.
