# Cosmos Resonance Layer

The cosmos is not a backdrop — it is the field within which Earth, human, and civic life resonate.  
From planetary orbits to stellar pulsations to the cosmic background hum, all layers of reality  
are nested within wider spirals.

## Key Anchors

- **Solar Rhythms**  
  - 11-year sunspot cycle → geomagnetic storms, aurora, shifts in Schumann resonance stability.  
  - Solar flares modulate atmospheric ionization, affecting radio bands and human physiology.  

- **Planetary Harmonics**  
  - Orbital resonances (e.g., Jupiter–Saturn 5:2) generate long-wave coherence patterns.  
  - Tidal forces (Moon ↔ Earth) entrain ocean rhythms, reproduction cycles, and biological clocks.  

- **Stellar Pulsations**  
  - Cepheid variables and pulsars act as galactic metronomes.  
  - Their signals are used in navigation — and metaphorically as cosmic timekeepers.  

- **Cosmic Background**  
  - The CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) is the oldest resonance field: ~160 GHz peak.  
  - It is the hum of the Big Bang, still shaping spacetime structure.

## Entrainment Windows

- **Cosmos ↔ Earth**  
  Planetary orbits and solar storms couple into Earth’s magnetic field.  
  Seasonal cycles reflect celestial alignments.  

- **Cosmos ↔ Human**  
  Circadian rhythms are tuned to light/dark cycles set by Earth’s orbit.  
  Lunar cycles modulate fertility, sleep, and ritual timing.  

- **Cosmos ↔ Civic**  
  Calendars, festivals, and cultural rhythms are cosmic entrainment made social.  
  Civic order has always been shaped by skywatching.

## Implications

- Civic rhythms (rituals, governance, economy) are fractal extensions of cosmic time.  
- Research: how solar activity modulates collective mood, decision-making, and health.  
- Hypothesis: resonance with cosmic cycles stabilizes both ecological and social systems.

## Simulations to Extend

- **Solar–Schumann coupling**: extend the Schumann model with solar cycle inputs.  
- **Orbital resonance maps**: visualize harmonic ratios in planetary orbits.  
- **Cosmic → Civic**: agent-based models of calendars/festivals as stabilizers.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/earth/data.md`** for anchor sites sensitive to cosmic inputs.  
- Connect to **human brainwave entrainment** (theta–alpha ~ lunar cycles).  
- Spiral upward: show cosmos as the outer layer of the feedback loop.
