# Cosmos — The Outer Resonance

The cosmos is not background — it is the resonant stage in which Earth and life emerge.  
Solar flares, lunar tides, and galactic spirals provide the wider cycles to which human  
and planetary rhythms entrain.

This layer ties the **local** (our breath, our plazas, our heartbeats)  
to the **universal** (the hum of stars, the orbit of moons, the spin of galaxies).  
It is both *vast* and *intimate* — the macrocosm reflected in the microcosm.

## Anchors

- **[Schumann Resonances](schumann.md)**  
  Earth–ionosphere cavity as planetary-scale heartbeat, resonant with brainwaves.  

- **[Solar Rhythms](solar.md)**  
  Sunspot cycles, flares, and electromagnetic storms shaping geomagnetism and health.  

- **[Lunar Tides](lunar.md)**  
  Gravitational pull of the moon entraining oceans, fertility cycles, and cultural calendars.  

- **[Galactic Spirals](galactic.md)**  
  The spiral arm as resonance geometry — a living symbol echoed in shells, storms, and cities.

## Why It Matters

- Human resilience is shaped by cosmic weather.  
- Civilization’s stability depends on anticipating and attuning to solar and lunar rhythms.  
- Our myths of the heavens may be read as early *pattern recognition* of entrainment windows.

## Next Steps

- Connect to **simulations** (e.g., solar cycle overlays with geomagnetic data).  
- Cross-link to **Field Layer** (human + Earth resonance under cosmic forcing).  
- Seed visualization projects: galactic spirals as coherence maps.
