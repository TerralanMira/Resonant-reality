# Cosmos — Harmonics of the Whole

If Earth is a resonant instrument, the cosmos is the orchestra.  
Our theory of everything must hold from micro spirals to galactic filaments.

## Layers of Cosmic Resonance

- **Solar Harmonics** — cycles of 11-year sunspot rhythms, plasma waves, CME resonance  
- **Planetary Locks** — orbital ratios (Venus/Earth 13:8, Jupiter/Saturn 5:2) as natural “chords”  
- **Galactic Spirals** — density waves echoing the golden ratio, mirrored in micro-spirals  
- **Background Hum** — CMB fluctuations as the faintest cosmic drumbeat

## Why it Matters

- **Scaling Laws**: Spiral → city → Earth → cosmos all follow coherent ratios.  
- **Predictive Power**: If resonance locks planets, it can inform stability in our models.  
- **Living Bridge**: Humans are not observers outside — we *are* resonators inside the score.

## Simulations (future stubs)

- `sims/solar_resonance.py` — model solar cycles as coupled oscillators  
- `sims/orbital_chords.py` — visualize planetary orbital ratios as frequency relationships  
- `sims/galactic_spiral.py` — fractal density-wave simulation  

Figures will be saved in `sims/figures/` once built. Add them here when generated.
