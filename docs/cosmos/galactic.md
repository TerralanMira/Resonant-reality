# Galactic Spirals — Fractals Above, Fractals Below

Our solar system orbits the galactic center every ~225 million years.  
Stars swirl in logarithmic spirals, echoing seashells and hurricanes.

## Anchors

- **Spiral Geometry** — golden ratio, logarithmic arcs  
- **Fractal Scaling** — galaxies, cyclones, DNA helices  
- **Background Radiation** — cosmic microwave background (CMB) as primordial hum  

---

## Human Coupling

- Myths of spiral stairways and cosmic serpents may encode galactic memory.  
- Meditation visions often spontaneously generate spiral imagery.  
- Civilizational archetypes mirror galactic cycles of collapse and renewal.  

---

## Implications

- Humanity is not isolated — we are nested in a galactic ecology.  
- Resonant cities can be designed as **micro-spirals**,  
  civic layouts tuned to cosmic pattern.

## Next Steps

- Link to simulations of spiral resonance (already in `sims/spiral_resonance.py`).  
- Cross-reference **docs/civic/plazas.md** (spiral design in urban space).  
- Add “galactic calendar” — mapping precession, zodiac, and long-wave cycles.
