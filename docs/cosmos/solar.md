# Solar Rhythms — The Sun as Conductor

The Sun is not static — it pulses, cycles, and storms.  
Its rhythms shape Earth’s electromagnetic and biological life.  

---

## Cycles

- **11-year sunspot cycle** — waxing and waning activity  
- **27-day rotation** — solar sectors sweep Earth  
- **Daily solar flux** — radiant modulation of ionosphere  

---

## Impacts

- Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) disrupt power grids, satellites, and circadian biology.  
- Auroras are visible traces of solar–Earth coupling.  
- Historical correlations link solar maxima/minima to civilizational unrest and creativity bursts.  

---

## Implications

- Civic resilience requires solar awareness.  
- “Cosmic weather” forecasts should sit alongside climate forecasts.  
- The Sun acts as **a tuning fork for collective coherence**.

## Next Steps

- Link data sources: NASA, NOAA space weather feeds.  
- Simulation stub: model HRV and market volatility against solar flux.  
- Cross-link to **docs/civic/governance.md** (resilience planning).
