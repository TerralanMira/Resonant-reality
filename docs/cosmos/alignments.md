# Cosmic Alignments — Sky ↔ Earth Resonance

Monuments, temples, and myths worldwide encode **cosmic timings**.  
These are not random coincidences — they are **field anchors**,  
where human, civic, and cosmic resonance interlock.

## Solar Alignments

- **Giza Pyramids (Egypt)**  
  - Oriented to cardinal directions with extraordinary precision.  
  - Pyramid shafts align to Orion’s Belt (Osiris myth) and Sirius (Isis myth).  
  - Symbolic of rebirth cycles tied to heliacal rising of Sirius.

- **Chichén Itzá (Maya)**  
  - On equinox, serpent shadow descends El Castillo pyramid.  
  - Links celestial timing to agricultural and ritual cycles.  
  - Civic population gathered in resonance with solar geometry.

- **Newgrange (Ireland)**  
  - Passage tomb aligned to winter solstice sunrise.  
  - Beam illuminates inner chamber, fusing death–rebirth myth with solar return.

## Lunar Alignments

- **Stonehenge (UK)**  
  - Encodes both solar solstices and 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle.  
  - Marks lunar standstills, showing advanced lunar knowledge.  

- **Chaco Canyon (Ancestral Puebloan, USA)**  
  - Petroglyph “Sun Dagger” tracks solstices and lunar standstills.  
  - Used as civic–cosmic calendar, organizing community ritual life.

## Planetary Alignments

- **Machu Picchu (Inca, Peru)**  
  - Temple of the Sun aligned to June solstice sunrise.  
  - Intihuatana stone (“hitching post of the sun”) tracks equinoxes.  
  - Inca cosmology: harmony between celestial cycles and empire governance.

- **Uaxactun (Maya)**  
  - E-groups oriented to track solstices and equinoxes.  
  - Venus cycles tied to war/peace decisions.  
  - Example of planetary timing guiding civic coherence.

## Galactic Alignments

- **Angkor Wat (Khmer, Cambodia)**  
  - Central towers aligned with solstices and equinoxes.  
  - Symbolically maps Mount Meru, the cosmic axis.  
  - Encodes Yuga cycles — linking galactic myth to civic order.

- **Teotihuacán (Mexico)**  
  - Avenue of the Dead aligned with Pleiades setting.  
  - Rebirth rituals tied to galactic crossings.  
  - Suggests intentional synchronization with larger stellar rhythms.

## Archetypal Resonance

- **Axis Mundi (World Axis)**  
  - Temples mirror cosmic poles: Mt. Meru, Tree of Life, World Mountain.  
  - Acts as a “conductor” channeling cosmic fields into civic centers.  

- **Myth ↔ Astronomy**  
  - Orion = Hunter/Fertility/Resurrection.  
  - Pleiades = planting & timing stars worldwide.  
  - Venus = morning star/war cycles (Maya, Aztec, Sumerian).

## Simulation Pathways

- Extend **LC-grid models** with solar/lunar input to show alignments shaping resonance windows.  
- Couple **Kuramoto oscillators** with planetary periods for entrainment thresholds.  
- Explore **galactic ray flux models** as drivers of mutation and long-wave cultural change.

---

## Why It Matters

- Ancient alignments were **resonance technologies**.  
- They tuned civic and human life into **cosmic cycles**.  
- Today, we can revive this literacy through **simulation + story + practice**.

## Next Steps

- Build interactive maps linking monuments ↔ sky cycles.  
- Cross-link to:  
  - `docs/civic/overview.md` (civic layer as temple-city).  
  - `docs/cosmos/overview.md` (cosmic context).  
- Add **visual gallery**: sky alignments + monuments + myth diagrams.
