# Schumann Resonances — Earth’s Electromagnetic Heartbeat

The Earth–ionosphere cavity acts as a vast resonant chamber.  
Lightning strikes excite standing waves that circle the globe,  
trapped between surface and ionosphere.

## Fundamental & Harmonics

- **7.83 Hz** — fundamental (the “heartbeat” of Earth)  
- **14 Hz, 20 Hz, 26 Hz, …** — higher harmonics  

These sit directly inside human brain rhythms:  
Theta, Alpha, Beta — bridging planetary and personal coherence.

## Human Coupling

- EEG studies show brain rhythms synchronize with Schumann peaks.  
- Meditation, trance, and REM sleep align with ~7–8 Hz windows.  
- HRV coherence is modulated by geomagnetic fluctuations.  

---

## Implications

- The planet is not just background — it is *part of the body’s oscillator set*.  
- Collective human states may resonate back into the field,  
  amplifying or dampening coherence.

## Next Steps

- Link simulation: **`sims/schumann_coupling.py`**  
- Cross-reference **docs/human/index.md** (brain, heart).  
- Add data stream: real-time Schumann monitoring stations.
