# Earth Layer

The Earth layer is where **resonance meets place**.  
It anchors the Theory of Everything into **landscapes, sites, and stories**.

---

## What it holds
- `data.md`: curated list of sites, coords, frequencies, and notes
- `map` (via sims): visual layer of Earth resonances
- narratives: myth, memory, archaeology, physics — fractal reflections of the hum

---

## Why it matters
- The Earth is not random — its **geometry and sites** mirror resonance bands.
- Ancient builders tapped these frequencies to **heal, align, and transmit knowledge**.
- Modern science detects the same (Schumann resonances, geomagnetic anomalies).

---

## How it links
- **To Simulations**: Earth frequencies can be compared to Kuramoto sync, LC grids, and Schumann models.
- **To Cosmos**: planetary resonance is a node in a much larger spiral.
- **To City**: design principles of Resonant City embed Earth’s wisdom into civic space.

## Next Steps
- Expand `data.md` with new sites.
- Add field data (measurements, EEG/EM field logs).
- Map resonance networks across ley lines.
