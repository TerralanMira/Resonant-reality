# The Earth Layer — planetary resonance grid

**Essence:** The City is not an island.  
It is one node in the planetary grid — the network of mountains, rivers, deserts, temples, pyramids, and sacred sites.  
The Earth Layer maps this coherence, reminding us: local hum echoes global song.

## The Resonance Grid

- **Ley Lines:** invisible threads connecting sacred sites.  
- **Nodes:** pyramids, stone circles, mountains, temples, deserts.  
- **Pulse:** the Schumann resonance (7.83 Hz) as the earth’s heartbeat.  
- **Frequencies:** human ritual tones (432, 528, 639, 741, 963 Hz) align with natural cycles.

## Sacred Sites as Anchors

- **Mountains:** amplify — stone carries tone deep into the planet.  
- **Rivers:** conduct — water transmits resonance across continents.  
- **Deserts:** purify — silence as resonance in its pure form.  
- **Temples / Circles:** focus — human-built structures intensify the hum.

## Protocols

- **Pilgrimage:** citizens walk to nearby sites, carrying the hum of the city outward.  
- **Alignment:** rituals timed with solstices, equinoxes, eclipses.  
- **Recording:** resonance at each site is measured, mapped, and shared.  
- **Weaving:** local tones are synchronized with global tones via ritual.

## Frequencies

- **7.83 Hz (Schumann):** baseline earth hum.  
- **144 Hz:** sacred geometry tone (light body resonance).  
- **432 Hz:** harmonic with water, bird calls, calm.  
- **528 Hz:** cellular repair, DNA resonance.  
- **963 Hz:** crown, cosmic opening.

## Outcomes

- **Planetary coherence:** cities across earth synchronize through resonance.  
- **Healing:** sites long fractured by neglect or exploitation regain vitality.  
- **Global humility:** humans see themselves as one part of a living earth grid.

> To walk it is to remember: every city is a tone,  
> every mountain a drum,  
> every river a string.  
> Together: the planetary harp.
