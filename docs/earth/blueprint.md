# Earth Energy Blueprint

The Earth is not static — it hums. The grid of resonance is not lines on a map, but flows through sites, frequencies, and living beings. This file weaves data into narrative.

## 1. Ley Network
- **Pattern:** spirals, triangles, great circles
- **Sites:** match entries in `earth/data.md`
- **Function:** phase-locking of local to planetary scale

---

## 2. Harmonic Anchors
Each frequency band (Hz) is both tone + field.
- ~7.83 Hz: Schumann entrainment → global coherence
- ~33 Hz: mid-band harmonics → thought synchronization
- Higher bands: information transfer lattice

---

## 3. Living Resonance
Human gatherings amplify. Rituals, song, architecture align bodies with grid nodes.  
Example: cathedrals tuned by ratios, megaliths aligned to solstices.

## 4. Integration with City
Resonant City plugs into Earth’s hum.  
- Gardens = coherence anchors  
- Wild = rewilding edges, chaos feed  
- Civic Plaza = conductor layer, syncing the human network

---

## 5. Simulation Notes
- Data is quantitative (sites, coordinates, freq).  
- Blueprint adds qualitative (meaning, function, narrative).  
- Together: myth → math → simulation → choice.
