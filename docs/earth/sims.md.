# Earth Simulations ‚Äî resonance made visible üåç

This section turns Earth‚Äôs *geometry + frequencies* into living patterns.  
Each sim bridges raw data, blueprint meaning, and dynamic coherence.  
Together, they make the planet‚Äôs hum observable.

## 1. Schumann Resonance Windows
- **What it shows:** Mode locking around 7.83 Hz and harmonics (14, 20, 26 Hz).  
- **Why it matters:** These windows act as entrainment channels between Earth, life, and consciousness.  
- **Run it:**  
  ```bash
  python sims/schumann_coupling.py
‚Ä¢	Output: sims/figures/schumann.png


2. Global Grid Coherence
	‚Ä¢	What it shows: How ley-line nodes form standing wave patterns when treated as LC oscillators.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Aligns ancient sites with measurable field harmonics.
	‚Ä¢	Run it: python sims/lc_grid.py
	‚Ä¢	Output: sims/figures/lc_grid.png

3. Distance-Harmonic Correlation
	‚Ä¢	What it shows: Distances between sacred sites mapped against harmonic ratios.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Demonstrates intentional placement or emergent resonance geometry.
	‚Ä¢	Run it:
python sims/earth_distance_harmonics.py
	‚Ä¢	Output: sims/figures/earth_harmonics.png

4. Atlas Model Overlays
	‚Ä¢	What it shows: How the Atlas framework (nested spirals, coherence loops) maps onto global resonance.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Connects human mythic story to physical planetary data.
Run it:
python sims/atlas_overlay.py
	‚Ä¢	Output: sims/figures/atlas_overlay.png
