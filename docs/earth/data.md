# Earth Data Sources

These datasets ground the models in physical reality.

## Core datasets
- **Global_Resonance_Map_Matrix.csv** — resonance intensity across geolocations.
- **Harmonic_Resonance_Distances.csv** — great-circle distances at harmonic intervals.
- **Grouped_Field_Energy_Blueprint.csv** — clustered coherence fields by frequency band.

## How used
- Input for Schumann coupling thresholds.
- Validation for LC grid topologies.
- Map overlays in `docs/earth/maps.md`.

## Next steps
- Expand datasets to include geomagnetic storm events.
- Correlate resonance bands with cultural/biological rhythms.
