# Earth Resonance Visuals

This page collects **maps and figures** that link Earth’s sites to resonance bands.

## Global Grid (conceptual)

- Ancient ley lines overlap with Schumann nodes.  
- Major megalithic sites (Giza, Stonehenge, Machu Picchu) lie on high-energy intersections.  
- Pattern resembles a planetary-scale LC circuit.

## Site–Frequency Gallery

- **Giza Plateau** → ~16 Hz overlay  
- **Stonehenge** → ~7–8 Hz  
- **Chichen Itza** → ~12 Hz  
- **Machu Picchu** → ~14 Hz  
- **Uluru** → ~7.83 Hz

## Coupling with Simulations

Visual resonance emerges when we compare:
- `spiral_resonance.py` → shows site-to-cosmic scaling.  
- `lc_grid.py` → shows geometry-dependent modes.  
- `schumann_coupling.py` → locks Earth’s hum to brainwaves.

## Next Step

As we expand:
- Replace placeholders with generated figures.  
- Animate shifts across epochs (ancient → modern grids).  
- Test harmonics in live field recordings.
