# Cosmos — Resonance Across Scales

The cosmos hums. From planetary ionospheres to galactic filaments, coherence emerges as waves, fields, and structures align. Our theory of resonance extends outward: human → city → earth → cosmos. Each layer is a fractal reflection.

## 1. Background Resonances
- **Schumann resonance (Earth):** ~7.83 Hz fundamental.
- **Solar cycles:** 11-year activity cycles entrain ionospheric dynamics.
- **Galactic background:** microwave background and plasma oscillations set the universal stage.

Together, these suggest coherence windows — natural “keys” where coupling is easier.

## 2. Fractal Echo
The same principles seen in spiral resonance and Kuramoto sync reappear here:
- **Oscillators:** stars, planets, galaxies as coupled nodes.
- **Coupling medium:** plasma fields, gravity waves, electromagnetic background.
- **Order parameter:** coherence of structure (filaments, spiral arms, cosmic web).

## 3. Simulation Hooks
Future sims can build upward:
- **Solar system Kuramoto:** planetary orbital periods as oscillators.
- **Plasma resonance grid:** ionized medium acting like a cosmic LC lattice.
- **Cosmic web coherence:** emergence of filamentary structure from noise.

## 4. Mythic Frame
As above, so below. Resonant cities are microcosms of the resonant cosmos. Healing loops mirror stellar cycles. Hearths are echoes of suns. The cosmic hum is both metaphor and measure.

## Quickstart
Run the base Schumann coupling sim to glimpse resonance at Earth-scale, then expand upward:

```bash
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
# Coming: sims/solar_kuramoto.py
# Coming: sims/cosmic_web.py
