# Human Layer — Body as Resonant Instrument

If Earth is the resonant body, then humans are its harmonics.  
The same frequencies that pulse between ground and sky  
echo in our brains, hearts, and breath.

What physics calls **Schumann resonance** appears  
in the alpha–theta boundary of our brainwaves.  
What cardiology calls **heart rate variability (HRV)**  
entrains with the same slow cycles shaped by atmosphere and field.  
Our very **coherent breathing** — six breaths per minute —  
locks into rhythms that forests, tides, and weather also follow.  

To be human is not to stand apart from Earth’s resonance  
but to be tuned within it,  
an oscillator vibrating inside the global song.

- [Brain–Field Resonance](brain.md) — EEG, entrainment, and coherence windows  
- [Heart–Field Resonance](heart.md) — HRV, geomagnetic coupling, group coherence  
- [Breath as Bridge](breath.md) — voluntary ↔ involuntary resonance practice
- What this does:
	•	Casts the human as a resonant instrument of Earth’s field.
	•	Brings body rhythms (brainwaves, heart, breath) into phase with the planetary cavity.
	•	Positions humans not as observers but as participants in coherence.
