# Figure: Resonance Ecology Spiral  

This diagram shows resonance across four layers — **Human, Earth, Civic, Cosmic** — woven into one spiral.  

---

## Layout

- **Center (Micro: Human)**  
  Concentric rings for brainwaves (δ, θ, α, β, γ), heartbeat (~1 Hz), and breath (~0.1 Hz).  
  Highlight Schumann fundamental (7.83 Hz) overlapping with α–θ bands.  

- **Next Ring (Earth)**  
  Schumann spectrum, geomagnetic pulsations, seismic oscillations.  
  Anchors: ley lines, node clusters, georesonant maps.  

- **Next Ring (Civic)**  
  Plaza, garden, conductor layers as tuned architectures.  
  Arches, domes, spirals marked as wave-shaping forms.  

- **Outer Ring (Cosmic)**  
  Solar cycles, orbital harmonics, galactic spirals.  
  Ouroboros encircles the whole — micro flows back into macro.

## Color & Symbol Key

- Human = blue–green spectrum (water, life).  
- Earth = deep green & brown (ground, field).  
- Civic = gold & white (design, culture).  
- Cosmic = violet & black (mystery, infinity).  

Arrows spiral outward and inward, showing feedback: *entrainment is bidirectional*.

## Caption

“Resonance spirals across scales — brainwaves hum with Earth, civic spaces amplify coherence, cosmic cycles ripple downward. Nothing is isolated; the spiral holds all layers as one ecology.”

## Implementation Notes

- To render: create a **spiral chart** with 4 concentric domains.  
- Overlay annotated frequency bands (Hz values).  
- Save figure to `docs/figures/resonance_ecology_spiral.png` once generated.
