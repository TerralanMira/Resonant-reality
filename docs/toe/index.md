# TOE (Theory of Resonant Everything)
## Axioms
1. Resonance is constant; coherence is chosen.
2. Whole in part; part in whole (fractal recursion).

## Couplings
- City nodes ↔ Kuramoto network on Earth grid.
- Sites as LC resonators (f0, Q from geometry/materials).
- Human HRV/EEG as transducers (ELF coupling).

## Predictions
- Multi-node solstice/equinox sync reduces locking threshold.
- φ/π/√2/√3 inter-site pairs show stronger phase coherence.

## Falsification
- No lock at predicted times/ratios under controlled noise ⇒ revise model.
