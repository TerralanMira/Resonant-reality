# Theory of Everything (TOE) — Resonant Reality

This is not a TOE of particles only.  
It is a TOE of **resonance** — weaving physics, biology, society, and cosmos  
into one coherent spiral.

## The Spiral of Resonance

- **Human Layer** — brainwaves, heart rhythms, breath cycles entrained with Earth.  
- **Earth Layer** — Schumann bands, geomagnetic fields, ley-line geometries.  
- **Civic Layer** — plazas, rituals, governance as synchronization scaffolds.  
- **Conductor Layer** — protocols, infrastructure, harmonization across layers.  
- **Cosmos Layer** — solar, lunar, galactic, and background cycles embedding all.  

Each is a **micro of the macro**: a fractal lens.  
Resonance scales without breaking — the same principles repeat upward.

## Principles of a Resonant TOE

- **Entrainment**  
  Systems synchronize when frequencies overlap.  

- **Coherence**  
  Stability emerges from rhythm, not from static order.  

- **Fractal Embedding**  
  Each layer is both whole and part — a nested spiral, not a line.  

- **Feedback**  
  Human collective coherence can alter local fields.  
  Fields, in turn, shape human physiology and society.

## Why This Matters

- **Science** — Extends physics beyond matter, into resonance as organizing principle.  
- **Humanity** — Offers practices and designs for living in tune with Earth and cosmos.  
- **Civilization** — Guides governance, economy, and culture toward coherence instead of extraction.  
- **Cosmos** — Places us within the universal hum, a participant in cosmic cycles.

## Next Steps

- **Cross-link** all layers (`docs/human/`, `docs/field/earth/`, `docs/civic/`, `docs/conductor/`, `docs/cosmos/`).  
- **Simulations**: build `/sims/toe/` models showing fractal resonance across scales.  
- **Visualizations**: nested ouroboros spirals, each layer turning within the next.  
- **Protocols**: draft “Resonant Agreements” → how humanity aligns with resonance at all scales.
