# TOE [theory]
Axioms, coupling, and predictions linking City↔Earth↔Cosmos.

## Axioms
1) Resonance is the constant; coherence is the choice.
2) Whole in part; part in whole (fractal recursion).

## Couplings
- City nodes ↔ Kuramoto network on Earth grid.
- Sites as LC resonators (Q, f0 set by geometry/materials).
- Human HRV/EEG as transducers (ELF band coupling).

## Predictions
- Coherence spikes at solstice/equinox multi-node rituals.
- Site pairs at φ/π/√2/√3 distances show lower locking thresholds.

## Falsification
- No lock at predicted times/ratios with controlled noise → revise model.
