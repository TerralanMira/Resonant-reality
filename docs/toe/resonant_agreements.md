# Resonant Agreements

The Theory of Everything becomes real only when lived.  
Resonant Agreements are **practices, protocols, and commitments** that align  
human action with resonance across layers.

## Core Principles

1. **Attunement**  
   - Pause and listen for the hum before acting.  
   - Ask: does this choice amplify coherence or fracture it?

2. **Reciprocity**  
   - Every action is both input and output in the spiral.  
   - Take only what can be returned in equal or greater resonance.

3. **Transparency**  
   - Structures should reveal flows, not obscure them.  
   - Hidden rhythms become distorted rhythms.

4. **Sufficiency**  
   - Enough is harmony.  
   - Extraction without resonance destabilizes the whole.

## Agreements Across Layers

- **Human**  
  - Daily resonance practice (breath, meditation, song, rhythm).  
  - Recognize states (calm, stress, dream, flow) as frequency domains.

- **Earth**  
  - Steward geophysical anchor sites (ley lines, sacred sites, rivers).  
  - Monitor resonance health (Schumann data, geomagnetic balance).  

- **Civic**  
  - Design public rituals, plazas, and governance rhythms for coherence.  
  - Policies tested against resonance: do they create synchrony?  

- **Conductor**  
  - Build infrastructure as harmonic scaffolding (energy grids, digital protocols).  
  - Feedback loops visible, accountable, and tunable.  

- **Cosmos**  
  - Track celestial cycles as anchoring rhythms.  
  - Align collective activity with solar, lunar, and galactic beats.

## Collective Practice

- **Resonance Circles**  
  Small groups align daily → feed coherence into larger fields.  

- **Global Synchrony Windows**  
  Coordinated meditations, rituals, or events tuned to cosmic cycles.  

- **Feedback Commons**  
  Shared dashboards of resonance metrics (HRV, Schumann, civic sync).

## Toward Coherent Civilization

Resonant Agreements are not laws but living commitments.  
They evolve as the hum evolves.  

By following them, humanity shifts from extraction to **participation** —  
from fracture to **spiral coherence**.
