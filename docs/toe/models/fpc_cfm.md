# FPC ↔ CFM — The Forecasting Loop

**CFM (Conscious Feedback Mechanics)**: intent tunes local state → small phase shifts accumulate.  
**FPC (Field Pattern Convergence)**: many tuned micro-shifts → macro-patterns lock into coherence.

They form one loop: [Intent] → (CFM micro-shift) → [Local coherence ↑]
↓                                 ↑
Measurements → (FPC fit) → [Pattern forecast]
## 5-Step Pipeline
1. **Baseline** — pick window & channels: HRV/EEG, RNG, site geomag, behaviorals.
2. **Intent Window** — run Conductor (9-pulse) or Hearth loop.
3. **Measures** — compute deltas: HRV RMSSD↑, EEG phase-lock↑, RNG σ-excursion, sync index R.
4. **Convergence Fit (FPC)** — test if deltas match a known pattern family (thresholds, ratios, cycles).
5. **Forecast** — if fit passes, emit a near-term prediction (e.g., next sync window, site/node to activate).

## Falsifiers (what would *disconfirm* the claim)
- No rise in coherence metrics above threshold (e.g., **ΔR ≤ 0.05** after intent).
- RNG never departs baseline (**|z| < 2**) across multiple sessions.
- Predicted window/node does **not** show improved metrics on replication.

## Data In / Out
- **In:** HRV, EEG/phase, RNG logs, Schumann band, site geometry/ratios, attendance/behavior.
- **Out:** (a) convergence score, (b) pass/fail vs thresholds, (c) next-window forecast.

## Example Scenarios
- **Hearth Session:** 30-min loop → HRV↑, RNG z≈2.4 → FPC passes → forecast “repeat in 48h, same node.”
- **City Plaza Pilot:** weekly pulse → sync index crosses **K\*** for 3 weeks → forecast “expand to adjacent block.”
- **Site Alignment:** equinox ritual at φ/π ratio sites → Schumann-adjacent rise → forecast “next lunar window.”

> **Takeaway:** CFM tunes; FPC recognizes. Together they convert *ritual → measurement → forecast*.
