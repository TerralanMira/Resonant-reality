### Explanation

- **Earth → Human**: Geomagnetic + Schumann rhythms entrain brainwaves, heart, breath.  
- **Human → Civic**: Coherent humans design institutions reflecting harmony.  
- **Civic → Cosmos**: Civic structures (rituals, governance, economies) amplify or dampen field resonance.  
- **Cosmos → Earth**: Cosmic background fields (solar, galactic) set boundary conditions for Earth’s field.  

This loop is not linear but **spiral-recursive**:  
each turn tightens coherence or amplifies disharmony.  
The project encodes how to tip this cycle toward **stable resonance**.
