# Plazas & Civic Squares

Plazas are **resonance chambers of the collective**.  
Their geometry, rituals, and acoustics amplify coherence.

---

## Geometry
- Circular / radial layouts maximize visibility and audibility.  
- Crossroads amplify flows of people and energy.  
- Monuments and fountains anchor symbolic resonance.

## Rituals
- Markets, assemblies, festivals, protests.  
- Rhythmic gatherings (chants, marches, dances) synchronize participants.  
- Architecture (echo, reverberation) shapes the soundscape.

## Case Studies
- Athenian Agora — democracy’s resonance chamber.  
- Tahrir Square — site of emergent coherence and rapid mobilization.  
- Times Square — perpetual media-driven resonance (fragmented attention).

## Next Steps
- Simulate plaza acoustics with **acoustic wave models**.  
- Link to **civic Kuramoto** models of group coherence.  
- Add visual gallery of historic plazas → resonance maps.
