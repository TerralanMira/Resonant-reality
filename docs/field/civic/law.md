# Law & Charter

Law is not only regulation — it is a **coherence code**.  
Civic charters attempt to synchronize freedom and order.

---

## Origins
- Oral traditions → elders as living resonance keepers.  
- Tablets & scrolls → encoding resonance into text.  
- Constitutions → meta-codes for civic identity.

## Resonance Role
- Defines civic boundaries (who belongs).  
- Encodes values in binding form.  
- Shapes coherence by aligning behavior with shared myth.

## Case Studies
- Magna Carta — resonance shift from monarchy to civic contract.  
- US Constitution — codifying pluralism as coherence.  
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights — attempt at planetary charter.

## Next Steps
- Simulate **coherence stability vs. legal dissonance**.  
- Cross-link with **human entrainment** (HRV coherence ↔ trust/legal compliance).  
- Build a “charter comparison map” as resonance spectra.
