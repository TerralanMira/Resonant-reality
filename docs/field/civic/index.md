# Civic Resonance Layer

Civic life is resonance scaled through institutions, rituals, and stories.  
Where plazas gather bodies, calendars synchronize time, laws encode order,  
and media steer attention â€” coherence or dissonance ripples outward.

## Anchors

- [Plazas & Civic Squares](plazas.md)  
  Geometry and ritual spaces that amplify collective resonance.  

- [Calendars & Ritual Time](calendars.md)  
  Synchronization technologies aligning human cycles with cosmic cycles.  

- [Law & Charter](law.md)  
  Civic codes as resonance frameworks shaping freedom and order.  

- [Media & Narrative](media.md)  
  Attention-setting instruments that harmonize or fragment the collective.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **Earth layer** (seasonal, geomagnetic, acoustic anchors).  
- Simulate civic coherence with Kuramoto and agent-based models.  
- Add visual galleries (plazas, calendars, charters, broadcast moments).  
- Trace **feedback loops**: how civic resonance stabilizes or destabilizes the planetary field.
