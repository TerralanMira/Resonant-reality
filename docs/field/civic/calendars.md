# Calendars & Ritual Time

Calendars are **synchronization technologies**.  
They align human rhythms with cosmic cycles.

---

## Functions
- Anchor agriculture (solar/lunar calendars).  
- Encode ritual festivals (harvest, solstice, equinox).  
- Mark collective identity through shared time.

## Resonance
- Solar → seasonal coherence.  
- Lunar → tidal and fertility cycles.  
- Stellar → long-term civilizational myths (e.g. Sirius rising in Egypt).

## Case Studies
- Mayan Long Count calendar.  
- Gregorian reform (1582) as civic re-synchronization.  
- Islamic lunar calendar (mobile against solar civic rhythms).

## Next Steps
- Build a **sim of calendar drift** → what happens when civic vs. cosmic cycles misalign?  
- Cross-link to **Earth layer** (geomagnetic / seasonal data).  
- Add visuals: spiral calendars, timewave fractals.
