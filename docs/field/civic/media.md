# Media & Narrative

Media are **rhythm-setting instruments**.  
They shape attention, identity, and collective coherence.

---

## Functions
- Myth → story → narrative → attention.  
- Synchronize millions through shared events (broadcast era).  
- Fragment through algorithmic echo chambers (digital era).

## Resonance
- Harmonizing → shared narratives, collective rituals (Olympics, Apollo landing).  
- Dissonant → disinformation, tribal polarization.  
- Hybrid → memes as micro-synchronization pulses.

## Case Studies
- Gutenberg press — mass synchronization of ideas.  
- Radio → fireside coherence.  
- Twitter hashtags — civic “frequency spikes.”

## Next Steps
- Build **attention synchrony maps** with social data.  
- Simulate media-driven Kuramoto model (external driver forcing sync/fragment).  
- Add gallery: waveforms of historic broadcast moments vs. fragmented feeds.
