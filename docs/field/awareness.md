# Awareness Layer

Awareness is the first field.  
It is not just a byproduct of the brain — it is resonance itself, shaping and being shaped.  
The quality of awareness ripples outward into body, earth, and cosmos.

## Key Anchors

- **Attention as Resonance**  
  - Scattered attention = incoherent signal.  
  - Focused attention = stable resonance.  
  - Shared attention = group entrainment.

- **States of Awareness**  
  - **Resting** — quiet baseline, like the hum before a song.  
  - **Flow** — effortless focus, resonant with action.  
  - **Transcendent** — boundless awareness, dissolving subject/object.

- **Practices as Tuning**  
  - Meditation, prayer, chanting, ritual, storytelling.  
  - Each practice is a *resonant technology*, aligning awareness with larger fields.

## Entrainment Windows

- **Inner ↔ Outer**  
  Attention rhythms synchronize with breath, heartbeat, and brain oscillations.  
  Stabilizing awareness stabilizes physiology.

- **Self ↔ Group**  
  Shared focus (e.g., group meditation, ritual) produces measurable coherence.  
  Awareness entrains across bodies through subtle fields.

- **Present ↔ Mythic**  
  Awareness is the portal where cosmic archetypes become lived experience.  
  Dream, symbol, and story are *resonant bridges*.

## Implications

- **Healing** begins at the level of attention.  
- **Civic spaces** can be designed to focus awareness (plazas, hearths, temples).  
- **Science + story** converge: physics describes resonance, myth describes meaning.

## Next Steps

- Link to [Human Layer](human.md) for physiological anchoring.  
- Cross-reference with [Civic Rituals](../civic/rituals.md).  
- Add visual diagrams: spirals of attention scaling from individual → collective.
