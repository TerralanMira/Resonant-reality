# Awareness Resonance Layer

Awareness is the **seed resonance** — the place where pattern first becomes felt.  
It is not separate from body, earth, or cosmos, but it is the *portal* through which coherence is recognized.

## Core Dimensions

- **Presence**  
  Attention is resonance shaped by intention.  
  What we attend to amplifies — awareness is a tuning fork.  

- **Inner Rhythms**  
  Awareness pulses with breath, heartbeat, and brain oscillations.  
  Mind states emerge in bands that echo the Earth’s spectrum:  
  - Delta — deep, formless sleep  
  - Theta — dream, trance, vision  
  - Alpha — calm, open receptivity  
  - Beta — analytic, structured focus  
  - Gamma — integration, insight, unity  

- **Field Coherence**  
  Awareness is never isolated. A single mind synchronizes with group, place, and planet.  
  Practices like meditation, chanting, or still presence are not escapes — they are **entrainment acts**.

## Awareness ↔ Human

- Awareness guides **neurophysiology**: calming the mind alters HRV, breath, and stress load.  
- **Narrative and meaning** live here: stories told in awareness reshape body chemistry.  
- Collective awareness → measurable shifts in group heart–brain coherence.

---

## Awareness ↔ Earth

- Schumann resonance overlaps with theta–alpha brain rhythms.  
- When awareness quiets, it **drops into planetary bands**.  
- Ritual spaces amplify this overlap — groves, caves, temples were built as resonant containers.

---

## Awareness ↔ Cosmos

- Awareness is not bounded by the skull.  
- Mystics across traditions describe awareness as a **field state** that can sense stars, galaxies, void.  
- Cosmological resonance: meditation synchronizes with cycles beyond Earth (lunar, solar, stellar).

---

## Implications

- Awareness is the *root lever*: cultivate presence, and resonance cascades through human, earth, cosmos.  
- Incoherent awareness (distracted, fragmented) leads to **field noise**.  
- Coherent awareness generates conditions for healing, creativity, and collective alignment.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/human.md`** for embodiment.  
- Add case studies: meditation EEGs, group intention research.  
- Connect to **simulations**: e.g., model brainwave overlap with Schumann bands.
