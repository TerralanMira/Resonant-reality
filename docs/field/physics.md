# Physics Sublayer — The Mathematical Hum

Physics is the skeleton of resonance.  
It gives precise form to what the hum feels like: oscillators, couplings, modes.

## Core elements
- **Oscillators** — pendulums, circuits, neurons all resonate when driven.  
- **Coupling** — when oscillators interact, they can lock into shared rhythm.  
- **Order parameter** — a single measure (R) captures collective coherence.  
- **Resonant modes** — geometry shapes which frequencies fit in a cavity.

## Simulations
These models make resonance visible:

- [Kuramoto Sync](../sims/kuramoto.md)  
  Many oscillators locking step by step as coupling increases.

- [LC Grid Modes](../sims/lc_grid.md)  
  Circuits laid out in patterns, showing how geometry shapes resonance.

- [Schumann Coupling](../sims/schumann.md)  
  Earth–ionosphere cavity with a natural entrainment window ~7.83 Hz.

## Why it matters
Physics provides the *grammar* of resonance.  
Without it, the hum is poetry without form.  
With it, myth and measure meet — stories embodied in equations.

> ✨ *Recursion:* Every layer (earth, human, city) has its physics.  
Cells, brains, plazas — all are oscillators in a field.
