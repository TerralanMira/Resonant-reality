# Cosmic Resonance Layer

Earth is nested inside larger fields.  
Planetary, solar, galactic, and universal oscillations  
cascade down into the biosphere — shaping rhythms of time, weather, and life.

## Key Anchors

- **Solar Cycles**  
  - ~11-year sunspot cycle drives geomagnetic fluctuations.  
  - Correlates with climate oscillations, human innovation bursts, and conflict rhythms.  
  - Solar flares + coronal mass ejections entrain Earth’s ionosphere.

- **Planetary Resonance**  
  - Orbital ratios (e.g., Jupiter–Saturn 5:2) act as long-wave metronomes.  
  - Tidal locking of Moon–Earth stabilizes rotation and climate.  
  - Astrology as archetypal encoding of field effects.

- **Galactic Oscillations**  
  - Solar system orbits Milky Way (~225 Myr).  
  - Passes through galactic arms modulate cosmic ray flux, linked to biodiversity shifts.  
  - Possible influence on geomagnetic reversals and extinction cycles.

- **Background Fields**  
  - Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) = fossil radiation of Big Bang.  
  - Subtle, omnipresent hum — the ground state of resonance.  
  - Sets the ultimate reference frame for all oscillations.

## Entrainment Windows

- **Cosmos ↔ Earth**  
  Solar storms drive geomagnetic activity.  
  Lunar cycles entrain tides, fertility rhythms, and circadian clocks.  
  Long-wave planetary cycles imprint collective history.

- **Cosmos ↔ Human**  
  Cultural myths encode solar/lunar archetypes.  
  Meditation, dream states, and ritual often reference cosmic time markers.  
  Collective human mood tracks solar and lunar rhythms.

- **Cosmos ↔ Collective Civilization**  
  Innovation waves, cultural renaissances, and collapse cycles  
  show correlations with solar activity and planetary alignments.

## Implications

- Human culture is cosmically tuned.  
- Timekeeping systems (calendars, astrology, ritual cycles)  
  are synchronization technologies.  
- Understanding cosmic resonance may bridge physics, myth, and sociology.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/earth.md`** (geomagnetics as mediator).  
- Add simulation: planetary orbital resonance → cultural cycles.  
- Explore archives: myths, megaliths, and calendars as early resonance models.
