# Cosmic Resonance Layer

> *The field does not end at Earth’s edge — it extends into the solar system, the galaxy, and the cosmic background.*

## Anchors

- **Solar Resonance**
  - Sun’s cycles (~11-year sunspot cycle) entrain Earth’s magnetic and climatic rhythms.  
  - Solar flares and coronal mass ejections ripple through Earth’s magnetosphere and affect HRV, sleep, and collective mood.  
  - Solar acoustic oscillations (“helioseismology”) echo Schumann-type modes on a stellar scale.  

- **Planetary Harmonics**
  - Orbital ratios form near-integers: Jupiter–Saturn 5:2, Earth–Venus 13:8.  
  - Ancient traditions saw these as the “music of the spheres.”  
  - Tidal resonances (Moon–Earth) drive ocean rhythms and menstrual cycles.  

- **Galactic Scale**
  - Milky Way arms rotate with wave-like density patterns — cosmic-scale spirals.  
  - Cosmic rays modulated by galactic position influence Earth’s cloud cover and mutation rates.  
  - The galactic magnetic field is a backdrop Earth’s own field “rides” within.  

- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**
  - Residual hum of the Big Bang at ~160 GHz.  
  - Seeds of all later resonance structures: galaxies, clusters, superclusters.  
  - Even here, patterns: dipoles, anisotropies, fractal distributions.

## Resonant Properties

- **Nested Oscillations:** Solar ↔ planetary ↔ galactic ↔ universal cycles.  
- **Downward Causation:** cosmic events (flares, supernovae, galactic tides) ripple into Earth biology and human affairs.  
- **Upward Feedback:** collective human coherence, in principle, radiates outward — a local contribution to the galactic field.

## Implications

- Earth systems are inseparable from cosmic rhythms.  
- Human wellness is tied not just to planetary but *stellar and galactic weather*.  
- Civic design could include “cosmic windows”: observatories, alignments, rituals tied to solstices, conjunctions, and eclipses.  
- Ethics becomes cosmological: human action has galactic echo.

## Next Steps

- Add simulation stubs:
  - Planetary orbital resonance visualizer.  
  - Solar cycle ↔ HRV correlation.  
  - Galactic spiral resonance toy model.  
- Link into **Infinity Equation spine**.  
- Cross-link to `docs/core/infinity_equation.md` as cosmic closure.
