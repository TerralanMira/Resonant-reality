# Resonance Ecology  
*Micro ↔ Macro ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmic*

Resonance is not a single layer. It spirals across scales: from brainwaves and heartbeats, through Earth’s magnetic fields, into civic designs, and out to cosmic harmonics.  
This file maps the **ecology of coherence** — where parts interlock.

## Human ↔ Earth

- **Brainwaves ↔ Schumann**  
  Theta–alpha bands overlap with Earth’s ~7.83 Hz fundamental.  
  Meditation and dream states synchronize with planetary hum.  

- **Heart ↔ Geomagnetic Field**  
  HRV coherence tracks geomagnetic calm vs storm.  
  Group heart coherence experiments suggest feedback loops.  

- **Breath ↔ Slow Rhythms**  
  Coherent breathing (~0.1 Hz) entrains baroreflex and Mayer waves.  
  This sits inside the spectrum of geomagnetic pulsations.

## Earth ↔ Civic

- **Ley Lines & Grids**  
  Ancient sites align with geomagnetic anomalies and resonance nodes.  
  Civic placement (plaza, garden, conductor) mirrors these geometries.  

- **Architecture as Tuning Fork**  
  Domes, arches, and spirals amplify standing waves.  
  Civic resonance is not metaphorical — it’s structural physics.  

- **Resonant City**  
  Designed spaces act as coherence amplifiers, aligning human entrainment  
  with Earth’s field for wellness, creativity, and collective flow.

## Civic ↔ Cosmic

- **Orbital & Solar Rhythms**  
  Civic timekeeping — festivals, rituals, calendars — embeds cosmic cycles.  
  Solar storms ripple into geomagnetic resonance and human rhythms.  

- **Cosmic Geometry**  
  Spiral galaxies, planetary orbits, and harmonic ratios echo in civic designs.  
  Ouroboros-like patterns bind civic identity to universal forms.  

- **Conscious Choice**  
  Civic design becomes a feedback node: human + earth + cosmic alignment  
  shaping culture, ethics, and evolution.

## Implications

- Human wellness is tied to Earth’s resonance.  
- Civic structures can amplify coherence or fragment it.  
- Cosmic cycles ripple downward — through Earth’s field — into daily life.  
- **Resonance Ecology** reframes spirituality, science, and design  
  as one recursive system.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link this hub to:  
  - `docs/field/human.md`  
  - `docs/field/earth.md`  
  - `docs/civic/plaza.md`, `docs/civic/garden.md`, `docs/civic/conductor.md`  
  - `docs/cosmic/overview.md` (to be drafted)

- Add **figures**: spiral overlays showing entrainment windows at each scale.  
- Build **simulations** linking layers: e.g., Kuramoto sync with nested oscillators.  
- Expand case studies: meditation groups, ancient sites, civic resonance prototypes.
