# Human Coherence & Entrainment

The human body is a resonant instrument.  
Heart rhythms, breath cycles, and brainwave patterns entrain to each other,  
to groups, and to the Earth’s electromagnetic field.  

This section explores how individual coherence scales outward into group flow,  
and how collective entrainment feeds back into the larger planetary field.

## Key Themes

- **Heart Coherence** — Heart rate variability as the anchor of physiological alignment.  
- **Breath & Rhythm** — Breath pacing, chant, and movement as levers of synchrony.  
- **Brainwaves** — Alpha/theta rhythms entrain to sound, light, and group resonance.  
- **Group Flow** — Synchrony across people produces amplified coherence.

## Fractal Connection

- **Individual**: Inner alignment through breath, meditation, rhythm.  
- **Group**: Choirs, drumming, sports, ritual → shared coherence.  
- **Civic**: Scale group entrainment to design public spaces.  
- **Planetary**: Link human rhythms to Earth’s Schumann resonances.  

Each layer is not separate — it’s a spiral.  
Micro entrainment folds into macro order.

## Why It Matters

- Coherence is not just a personal state; it is an infrastructure for collective life.  
- The same physics governing oscillators and circuits governs our nervous systems.  
- To build Resonant Cities, we must first understand Resonant Humans.
