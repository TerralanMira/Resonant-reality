# Human Entrainment Practices

Resonance is not abstract — it is lived.  
Every culture has discovered techniques for syncing body, mind, and community with rhythm.  
Here we gather methods old and new, scientific and experiential.

## 1. Breath

- **Coherent Breathing (0.1 Hz)**  
  ~6 breaths/minute → maximizes HRV, balances autonomic nervous system.  
  Practiced in yoga (pranayama), qigong, and modern biofeedback.  

- **Box Breathing (Navy, yogic roots)**  
  Inhale–hold–exhale–hold (equal length).  
  Creates stability and focus.  

- **Resonant Exhalation**  
  Singing, chanting, sighing — extends vagal tone, relaxes body.

## 2. Sound

- **Chant & Mantra**  
  Frequencies anchor attention, extend breath, induce synchrony.  

- **Drumming**  
  Group drumming entrains brainwaves and HRV,  
  facilitating trance and bonding (studies show alignment across participants).  

- **Music**  
  Structured resonance: tempo → heartbeat entrainment; harmony → emotion regulation.

## 3. Movement

- **Walking Meditation**  
  Step rhythm couples to breath and attention.  

- **Dance**  
  Individual → catharsis; group → synchronization (tribal, rave, ecstatic).  

- **Tai Chi / Qigong**  
  Slow periodic cycles, aligning inner and outer fields.

## 4. Stillness

- **Meditation**  
  Alpha–theta states → entrain with Schumann frequencies.  

- **Prayer / Contemplation**  
  Directed coherence of attention and intent.  

- **Float / Isolation tanks**  
  Amplify internal rhythms, reduce external noise.  

---

## 5. Collective Entrainment

- **Group Meditation Experiments**  
  Measured decreases in local crime/violence during large synchronized practice.  

- **Choral Singing**  
  HRV synchrony across singers; shared breathing cycles.  

- **Mass Events**  
  Ritual, sports, concerts → temporary “one-body” effect.  

---

## 6. Emerging Technologies

- **Biofeedback & Neurofeedback**  
  Real-time HRV/EEG entrainment guidance.  

- **Binaural Beats / Brainwave Entrainment**  
  Artificial audio stimulation at frequency differences.  

- **Wearables**  
  HRV monitors, resonance-breath pacers, collective dashboards.  

---

## Implications

- Entrainment = an *interface layer* between individual humans and planetary resonance.  
- Practices are not just “wellness tools” but **field-alignment protocols**.  
- Collective synchronization may represent a lever for stabilizing social–ecological systems.

## Next Steps

- Add case studies (e.g., TM studies, HeartMath Global Coherence).  
- Cross-link to **`docs/field/city/index.md`** (Resonant City) — collective entrainment → civic design.  
- Connect to **simulations**: model feedback loops of individual coherence → group → field.
