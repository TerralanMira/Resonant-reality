# Earth Resonance Layer

Earth is a resonant body.  
Its electromagnetic envelope, fluid circulations, and tectonic oscillations  
all provide **carrier waves** in which human and collective rhythms embed.

## Core Anchors

- **Schumann Resonances**  
  - Global electromagnetic cavity between Earth’s surface and ionosphere.  
  - Fundamental at **7.83 Hz**, with higher harmonics (~14, 20, 26, 33 Hz).  
  - Overlaps directly with human **alpha–theta brainwaves**.  
  - Varies with lightning activity, ionosphere height, and solar input.

- **Geomagnetic Field**  
  - Dynamic shield driven by Earth’s liquid iron core.  
  - Pulses in **ULF/ELF bands** (0.01–10 Hz).  
  - Storms and quiet phases affect human HRV, cognition, and collective mood.  

- **Ocean & Atmospheric Tides**  
  - Lunar and solar gravity entrain ~12h and 24h oscillations.  
  - Seasonal shifts and El Niño/La Niña cycles ripple into ecosystems and behavior.  

- **Seismic & Tectonic Rhythms**  
  - Earthquakes and volcanic tremors emit ELF infrasound and ground oscillations.  
  - Indigenous traditions often interpreted these as Earth’s “voice.”

- **Global Electric Circuit**  
  - Thunderstorms, ionosphere, and ground create a planetary-scale circuit.  
  - Lightning discharges pump energy into Schumann cavity.

## Earth ↔ Human

- Schumann bands overlap brain and heart rhythms.  
- Geomagnetic activity correlates with hospital admissions, accidents, and mood shifts.  
- HRV studies show **direct coupling** between human physiology and geomagnetic indices.

---

## Earth ↔ Awareness

- Meditation, ritual, and coherent group practices show correlation with geomagnetic calm.  
- Suggests **bidirectional feedback**: not only are humans affected by Earth’s field,  
  but human coherence may stabilize local geophysical turbulence.

## Earth ↔ Cosmos

- Solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and cosmic rays drive geomagnetic storms.  
- Lunar cycles entrain tides, reproduction, and sleep patterns.  
- Planetary alignments affect tidal forces and magnetosphere currents.  

---

## Implications

- Earth is a **nested resonator** within the solar system.  
- Its bands create **channels of coherence** between human, collective, and cosmic scales.  
- Disruption in geomagnetic stability links to mental health, ecological stress, and social turbulence.  
- Coherent human collectives may act as **resonant stabilizers** for Earth systems.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/human.md`** for physiological resonance.  
- Add anchor data: NOAA geomagnetic indices, Schumann monitoring stations.  
- Connect to **simulations**: ELF wave propagation, coupling models with HRV datasets.  
- Prepare visualization of **Earth’s resonant cavity** with overlay of human bands.
