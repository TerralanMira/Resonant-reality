# Earth Layer

> This layer is the **grounding node** in the Spiral of Resonance:  
> üåç Earth ‚Üî üß¨ Human ‚Üî üèõÔ∏è Civic ‚Üî ‚ú® Cosmos.  
> All other layers entrain to its baseline rhythms.

## Anchors

- **Schumann Resonances**  
  Earth‚Äôs cavity between ground and ionosphere hums at ~7.83 Hz,  
  overlapping with human alpha‚Äìtheta rhythms.  

- **Geomagnetic Storms & Calms**  
  Solar winds buffet the magnetosphere, producing turbulence  
  that cascades into human HRV, sleep, and mood.  

- **Biospheric Cycles**  
  Seasonal, tidal, and diurnal rhythms entrain biology and culture.

## Earth in the Spiral

- **Feeds Human Layer**:  
  Brainwaves, heartbeats, and breath cycles tune to geomagnetic calm or storm.  

- **Feeds Civic Layer**:  
  Agricultural calendars, navigation, and architecture are Earth-coupled.  

- **Feeds Cosmic Layer**:  
  Earth‚Äôs envelope acts as transducer for solar and galactic rhythms.

## Implications

- Stabilizing Earth rhythms (through ecological stewardship, reduced EM noise, rewilding)  
  is not just ‚Äúenvironmental‚Äù but **field hygiene** for the entire spiral.  

- The Earth layer is where **entrainment becomes ecology**:  
  caring for biosphere = caring for the resonance backbone.

- Link to `docs/field/civic.md` (ritual calendars, architecture).  
- Connect to `docs/field/cosmos.md` (solar + cosmic inputs).
