# Earth Resonance Layer

Earth is not just a stage for life — it is a resonant body.  
Its fields, cavities, and cycles shape every living system.  
Mountains, oceans, forests, and ionospheric layers  
all contribute to a global electromagnetic orchestra.

## Key Anchors

- **Schumann Resonances**  
  - Global EM cavity between Earth’s surface and ionosphere.  
  - Fundamental ~7.83 Hz, with higher modes (14, 20, 26, 33 Hz).  
  - Overlaps with human brainwave bands → natural entrainment.

- **Geomagnetic Field**  
  - Shields Earth from solar wind.  
  - Daily fluctuations align with circadian biology.  
  - Storms trigger measurable changes in HRV and global mood.

- **Ley & Energy Lines**  
  - Ancient traditions mapped “dragon lines,” “songlines,” or meridians.  
  - Modern geomancy + geophysics suggest correlations with crustal conductivity,  
    groundwater flows, and geomagnetic anomalies.

- **Geological Oscillators**  
  - Volcanoes, tectonic stress, and ocean waves generate ELF signals.  
  - These serve as slow planetary metronomes.

## Entrainment Windows

- **Earth ↔ Human**  
  Brainwaves and HRV couple with Schumann and geomagnetic frequencies.  
  Geomagnetic storms affect sleep, mood, and cognition.

- **Earth ↔ Cosmos**  
  Solar flares and cosmic rays drive fluctuations in geomagnetics.  
  Earth resonates within a broader stellar system.

- **Earth ↔ Collective Culture**  
  Sacred sites often align with nodes of geomagnetic significance.  
  Architecture, ritual, and pilgrimage reflect unconscious mapping of fields.

## Implications

- Human–Earth coherence is not metaphor but physics.  
- Cultural myths about sacred landscapes are encoded **field knowledge**.  
- Monitoring Schumann + geomagnetics offers a way to measure  
  “collective weather” alongside physical climate.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/human.md`** (entrainment overlaps).  
- Build a **resonance atlas**: map sacred sites + geophysical data.  
- Connect to **simulations**: e.g., LC-grid models of planetary cavities.
