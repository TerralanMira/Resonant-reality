# The Resonance Field

The field is not separate from us — it is the living weave of awareness, body, planet, and cosmos.  
Each layer resonates within and through the others, spiraling coherence from micro to macro.

## Layers of the Field

- **Awareness Layer**  
  - Thought, perception, and intention ripple as fields.  
  - Coherence here sets the baseline: scattered awareness fragments, unified awareness stabilizes.  
  - Practices: meditation, attention training, intention-setting.

- **Human Layer**  
  - The body as a resonant instrument.  
  - Brainwaves, heart rhythms, breath cycles, and cellular signaling align with Earth’s rhythms.  
  - Human coherence can amplify or disturb wider fields.

- **Earth Layer**  
  - Geomagnetic activity, Schumann resonances, and tectonic/atmospheric flows.  
  - Sacred sites and ley networks mark nodes of intensified resonance.  
  - Human presence and collective rituals feed back into the planet’s coherence.

- **Cosmic Layer**  
  - Solar cycles, planetary harmonics, galactic signals.  
  - Resonances at this scale shape Earth’s rhythms and set the “cosmic weather.”  
  - Myth and science meet here: star lore and astrophysics both describe our tuning to the whole.

## The Spiral Relation

- Awareness ↔ Human ↔ Earth ↔ Cosmos is not a ladder but a **spiral**.  
- Each layer informs and entrains the others:  
  - Clear awareness stabilizes the body.  
  - Coherent human rhythms entrain with Earth.  
  - Earth fields resonate with solar and cosmic cycles.  
  - Cosmic rhythms return as archetypes, dreams, and myth.

## Implications

- Healing is not just personal: it is planetary.  
- Rituals and civic design can tune groups to Earth and cosmic cycles.  
- Simulations (see `/docs/sims/`) show how resonance scales.  
- Research should cross-link all layers — biology, geophysics, astrophysics — through coherence.

## Next Steps

- Flesh out each layer: [Awareness](awareness.md), [Human](human.md), [Earth](earth.md), [Cosmos](cosmos.md).  
- Add figures: spirals linking micro and macro.  
- Build cross-links: civic plaza ↔ awareness practices, earth sites ↔ human coherence studies, cosmic cycles ↔ mythic calendars.
