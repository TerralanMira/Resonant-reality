# Field Layer — Resonance Made Tangible

The field is where the abstract hum of coherence touches matter.  
This layer bridges physics → earth → collective human experience.

---

## What it holds
- **LC circuits and grids**: geometry of resonance (see `sims/lc_grid.md`).
- **Schumann windows**: earth–ionosphere cavity around 7.83 Hz.
- **Sites of coherence**: earth nodes where myth + measure overlap.
- **Human entrainment**: heart–brain rhythms syncing to field frequencies.

---

## Why it matters
The field layer grounds the Theory of Everything into felt reality:
- **Physics** gives structure (oscillators, couplings, resonances).
- **Earth** provides stage (geomagnetic sites, resonant cavities).
- **Humans** bring coherence (hearts, minds, rituals entraining together).

When aligned, these domains **spiral into visible coherence** —  
a city that resonates with its land, its people, its cosmos.

As above, so below. As within, so without.
