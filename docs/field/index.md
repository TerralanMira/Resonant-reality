# Field Layer — Earth as Resonant Body

Beneath all coherence lies a field.  
The Earth is not a silent rock but a resonant cavity:  
lightning strokes excite the ionosphere, mountains shape standing waves,  
oceans and forests breathe in planetary cycles.

What physics names “Schumann resonances” or “geomagnetic indices”  
ancient traditions called the **world hum**.  
This layer gathers those signals — frequencies that bind us all.  

To trace them is to touch the **carrier wave**  
upon which human hearts, communities, and civilizations ride.
