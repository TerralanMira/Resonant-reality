# Field Layer — Earth’s Resonant Body

Earth is not inert — it is a resonant organism.  
The geomagnetic field, ionospheric cavity, crustal vibrations, and biosphere  
form a layered coherence field that shapes and is shaped by life.

This layer ties the **human resonance** (heart, brain, breath)  
to the **planetary resonance** (Schumann, geomagnetic, seismic).

## Anchors

- **[Geomagnetic Fields](earth.md)**  
  The living magnetosphere as protective and regulatory field.  

- **[Human Resonance](human.md)**  
  Brainwaves, heart rhythms, and breath cycles tuned into Earth frequencies.  

- **[Data Anchors](earth/data.md)**  
  Sites, sensors, and experiments grounding resonance in measurement.

## Why It Matters

- Human health is inseparable from the stability of Earth’s fields.  
- Coherence practices amplify resilience under geomagnetic stress.  
- Tracking resonance helps anticipate both ecological and societal tipping points.

## Next Steps

- Link simulations: brainwave ↔ Schumann coupling, HRV ↔ geomagnetic storms.  
- Cross-link with **civic layer** (group practices ↔ collective coherence).  
- Visualize data streams from real-world field monitors.
