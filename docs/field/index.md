# The Spiral of Resonance

The field is not linear.  
It is a spiral of **Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos** —  
each layer both enclosing and being enclosed,  
each one feeding coherence back into the others.

How to Read the Spiral
	•	Earth ↔ Human
Geophysical rhythms shape brainwaves, heart rhythms, and breath.
Human coherence in turn can stabilize or disturb geomagnetic calm.
	•	Human ↔ Civic
Individual resonance practices (breathing, meditation, ritual)
scale into group coherence, civic trust, and cultural rhythms.
	•	Civic ↔ Cosmos
Collective structures (governance, economy, ritual calendars)
tune societies to cosmic cycles — solstices, resonances, orbital beats.
	•	Cosmos ↔ Earth
Cosmic background fields and solar cycles entrain Earth’s envelope.
Planetary feedback — from biosphere to technosphere —
then modulates how we receive and respond.

Why Spiral?
	•	Feedback, not hierarchy:
No top, no bottom. Each node is both micro and macro.
	•	Recursion:
The whole shows in each part; the part reflects the whole.
	•	Navigation:
Every document and simulation here is a window into this loop.

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Each section (Earth, Human, Civic, Cosmos) should link back here as “its place in the spiral.”
	•	Simulations should be marked as micro mirrors of specific loop arcs.
	•	Civic prototypes can be framed as rituals for stabilizing feedback in the spiral.
