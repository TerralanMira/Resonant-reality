# Civic Layer

> This layer is the **collective conductor** in the Spiral of Resonance:  
> 🌍 Earth ↔ 🧬 Human ↔ 🏛️ Civic ↔ ✨ Cosmos.  
> Where many bodies entrain, cities and cultures hum into coherence.

## Anchors

- **Plazas** — civic-scale resonance chambers (geometry for gathering).  
- **Rituals** — structured entrainment (music, dance, meditation, festivals).  
- **Governance** — decision-making as rhythm, consensus as phase lock.  
- **Economy** — circulation as flow, value indexed to coherence.  
- **Education** — transmission as resonance, learning as entrainment.

## Civic in the Spiral

- **Receives from Human**:  
  Rituals, gatherings, and institutions encode personal rhythms into collective form.  

- **Feeds Earth**:  
  Cities alter geomagnetic and ecological rhythms; coherent design reduces dissonance.  

- **Feeds Cosmos**:  
  Civic myths, symbols, and architecture echo archetypal patterns.  
  Temples, observatories, and festivals align society with the stars.

## Implications

- Civic design is **field design**: plazas, rituals, and governance act as resonant amplifiers.  
- Economic and political instability can be reframed as **loss of coherence**.  
- Cities can be tuned — geometry, policy, and ritual — to harmonize with Earth and Cosmos.

## Next Steps

- Link to `docs/civic/plazas.md`, `docs/civic/rituals.md`, `docs/civic/governance.md`, `docs/civic/economy.md`, `docs/civic/education.md`.  
- Cross-link simulations of group coherence (Kuramoto, Spiral Resonance, Resonant Currency).  
- Add case studies of **coherent cities** (e.g. temple-plaza societies, music festivals, modern eco-cities).
