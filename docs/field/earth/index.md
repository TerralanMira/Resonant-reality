# Earth Resonance Layer

The Earth itself is a resonant body — a living circuit of stone, water, air, and fire.  
Its geomagnetic field, crustal lattice, and atmospheric cavity form the substrate  
for every rhythm of human and biospheric life.

## Core Resonances

- **Schumann Modes**  
  - Fundamental ~7.83 Hz, harmonics at ~14, 20, 26 Hz.  
  - Overlaps human brain alpha–theta and heart coherence bands.  
  - Acts as a global “carrier wave” for biological synchronization.  

- **Geomagnetic Pulses**  
  - Storms, calm days, polarity reversals.  
  - These modulate HRV, cognition, even collective mood.  
  - Serves as a planetary metronome, slow but powerful.  

- **Ley Currents & Tellurics**  
  - Ancient sites aligned with conductive paths in the crust.  
  - Megaliths, temples, and pyramids often sit at nodal points.  
  - Suggests civilizations tapped Earth’s lattice for coherence.

## Entrainment Pathways

- **Human ↔ Earth**  
  Meditation, drumming, chanting, and ritual align human cycles with planetary oscillations.  

- **Civilization ↔ Earth**  
  Cities act as amplifiers or dampers.  
  Layouts that honor geomagnetic and hydrological flows create resonance;  
  extractive grids fracture it.  

- **Earth ↔ Cosmos**  
  Solar winds, lunar tides, and galactic rays continuously re-tune the geomagnetic envelope.

## Anchors & Blueprints

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/earth/data.md`** (catalog of resonant sites).  
- Cross-link to **`docs/field/earth/schumann.md`** (detailed entrainment window).  
- Cross-link to **`docs/field/earth/lc_grid.md`** (geometry → resonance spectrum).

## Implications

- Human wellness is inseparable from planetary wellness.  
- Civilization design must weave with Earth’s lattice, not against it.  
- Resonant cities become nodal extensions of Earth’s circuitry.

## Next Steps

- Add site-specific case studies: Giza Plateau, Chaco Canyon, Stonehenge, Uluru.  
- Link to **simulations**: LC grid modes, Schumann coupling.  
- Develop visual overlays: resonance maps, ley line circuits, node activations.
