# Earth Sublayer — Geomagnetic Resonance

Earth hums.  
The geomagnetic field forms a resonant cavity between ground and ionosphere,  
anchoring life in rhythm.

## Core structures
- **Schumann Resonances** — standing waves in the Earth–ionosphere cavity (~7.83 Hz fundamental).  
- **Magnetic Sites** — places of unusually high geomagnetic activity, often tied to myth.  
- **Ley-like Networks** — alignments of sacred sites may reflect resonant pathways.

## Data
See [data.md](data.md) for structured site lists.  
Format: name, lat, lon, notes.

## Simulations
- [Schumann Coupling](../../sims/schumann.md)  
  Visualizes entrainment near 7.83 Hz.

- [LC Grid Modes](../../sims/lc_grid.md)  
  Abstract version of Earth’s cavity modes.

## Why it matters
Earth’s hum may entrain biological rhythms:  
- Alpha brain waves (~8–12 Hz)  
- Heart coherence rhythms (~0.1 Hz harmonics)  

Ancient cultures tuned to this hum: temples, stone circles, plazas often sit at resonant nodes.
