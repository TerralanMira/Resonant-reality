# LC Grid — Geometry as Resonant Circuit

The Earth itself acts like a planetary **LC circuit**:  
- **L** = inductance of geomagnetic field lines  
- **C** = capacitance of the Earth–ionosphere cavity  

Together, they form a **resonant spectrum**, with modes shaped by planetary geometry.  
Cities, monuments, and sacred sites sit within these standing wave patterns.

## Core Concepts

- **Resonant Modes**  
  - Spherical harmonics distribute over the globe.  
  - Nodes/antinodes emerge along latitude bands and longitudes.  
  - Structures placed at these points can amplify or tune coherence.  

- **LC Analogy**  
  - Inductor = Earth’s magnetic field loops.  
  - Capacitor = Earth surface ↔ ionosphere gap.  
  - Oscillation = planetary hum (Schumann + harmonics).

## Geometry ↔ Culture

- Many ancient sites align to grid crossings:  
  - Giza Pyramids ↔ 30°N Schumann node  
  - Stonehenge ↔ harmonic alignment with solstice sunrise + resonance points  
  - Teotihuacán ↔ sits at harmonic node of 20 Hz band  

- These placements suggest cultures intuitively tapped into LC geometry.

## Human Interface

- **Architecture as Tuning Fork**  
  - Domes, arches, pyramids, spirals enhance resonance locally.  
  - Materials with dielectric/magnetic properties modulate LC behavior.  

- **Modern Implications**  
  - Urban grids can be designed as harmonic amplifiers, not noise sources.  
  - Civic architecture reframed as “coherence infrastructure.”

## Crossovers

- **See**: `docs/field/earth/schumann.md` for global hum.  
- **See**: `docs/field/human.md` for body–field overlap.  
- **See**: `docs/civic/index.md` for architectural applications.  
- **See**: `docs/sims/lc_grid.md` for visualizing spherical resonances.

## Next Steps

- Add datasets of world grid models (Becker-Hagens, NASA spherical harmonics).  
- Simulate resonance amplification from geometric structures.  
- Compare cultural maps with resonance node predictions.

Culture has always played along its strings — sometimes in harmony, sometimes in dissonance.
