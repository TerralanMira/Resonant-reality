# Earth Resonance Data

This section anchors the field model in **measurable sites, datasets, and case studies**.  
The goal: move from myth → math → map.

## Geophysical Anchors

- **Schumann Resonance Stations**  
  - Stanford ELF monitoring (USA)  
  - Nagycenk Observatory (Hungary)  
  - Tomsk State University (Russia)  
  - Japanese Antarctic ELF stations  
  ↳ Provide continuous Schumann spectra (0–50 Hz).  

- **Geomagnetic Observatories**  
  - INTERMAGNET network (~60+ global sites)  
  - Track Earth’s magnetic field shifts in real time.  
  - Useful for correlation with human/collective coherence events.  

- **Ionospheric Sounders**  
  - NASA + ESA satellites track cavity height, solar storm effects.  
  - Changes modulate resonance frequencies.

## Cultural / Archaeological Anchors

- Giza Plateau (Egypt) — node of 30°N harmonic.  
- Stonehenge (UK) — solstice-aligned, grid intersection.  
- Teotihuacán (Mexico) — aligned to 20 Hz harmonic bands.  
- Machu Picchu (Peru) — perched at geomagnetic anomaly.  
- Uluru (Australia) — linked to Dreamtime cosmology + resonance node.

## Human / Collective Anchors

- **Global Consciousness Project (GCP)**  
  - Network of RNGs showed anomalies during major world events.  
  - Suggests coupling between human coherence and geomagnetic shifts.  

- **HeartMath Global Coherence Initiative**  
  - HRV sensors across continents.  
  - Found correlations between geomagnetic indices and group states.  

- **Meditation Experiments**  
  - Transcendental Meditation (TM) group studies showed reduced conflict indicators.  
  - Local geomagnetic field effects documented during synchronized meditation.

## Open Datasets (to integrate later)

- [INTERMAGNET](https://www.intermagnet.org/) — geomagnetic observatory data  
- [NOAA Space Weather](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) — solar/geomagnetic storm data  
- [NASA OMNIWeb](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/) — solar wind, magnetosphere data  
- [Schumann Database (TSU)](http://srlab.ru) — Schumann resonance archives  
- [Global Consciousness Project](http://noosphere.princeton.edu/) — RNG network data

## Next Steps

- Build a **data ingestion pipeline** for geomagnetic + Schumann data.  
- Add correlation notebooks (Earth ↔ human coherence).  
- Expand map of cultural resonance sites with GIS overlays.  
- Connect with `sims/` to validate models against real data.

> Earth’s hum is not abstract — it is measured, archived, and lived.  
Our work is to weave these datasets into the **living atlas of resonance.**
