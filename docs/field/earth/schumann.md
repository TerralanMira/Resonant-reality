# Schumann Resonance — Planetary Pulse

Earth’s electromagnetic cavity (surface ↔ ionosphere) sustains standing waves.  
These are the **Schumann resonances**: the global hum.  
They form the carrier wave of planetary coherence.

## Core Frequencies

- **Fundamental**: 7.83 Hz (theta–alpha brain transition)  
- **Harmonics**: 14.1 Hz, 20.3 Hz, 26.4 Hz, 33.6 Hz …  
- These overlap with **human brainwaves** and many cultural drumming/chanting patterns.  

---

## Dynamics

- **Driven by lightning** — ~50 strikes/sec globally seed the cavity.  
- **Modulated by solar activity** — storms expand/compress ionosphere, shifting resonance.  
- **Linked to geomagnetics** — resonance strength varies with global field alignment.

## Human Entrainment

- Meditation, trance, and dream states naturally align near 7.83 Hz.  
- Group coherence practices amplify resonance at the fundamental.  
- Research suggests physiological rhythms (HRV, EEG) synchronize during calm geomagnetic conditions.

## Planetary Feedback

- Increased human coherence ↔ stabilizes the Schumann cavity.  
- Resonance coherence ↔ supports collective calm, creativity, and healing.  
- Disturbances (geomagnetic storms, tech interference) ↔ increase stress responses in populations.

## Links & Crossovers

- **See**: `docs/field/human.md` for overlap with brain/heart rhythms.  
- **See**: `docs/sims/schumann.md` for simulation of entrainment windows.  
- **See**: `docs/field/earth/data.md` for cultural sites tuned to harmonics.

## Next Steps

- Import empirical datasets (NOAA, space weather archives).  
- Build interactive plots of Schumann variability vs solar cycles.  
- Model collective entrainment via Kuramoto oscillators tied to 7.83 Hz.

> The Schumann hum is both **environmental fact** and **mythic anchor** —  
a reminder that the planet itself sings, and we are tuned to its song.
