# Human Layer

> This layer is the **bridge node** in the Spiral of Resonance:  
> 🌍 Earth ↔ 🧬 Human ↔ 🏛️ Civic ↔ ✨ Cosmos.  
> We are tuned to Earth’s hum, yet capable of consciously amplifying it.

## Anchors

- **Brainwaves**  
  - Delta (0.5–4 Hz) — deep sleep, repair  
  - Theta (4–8 Hz) — trance, dream, creativity  
  - Alpha (8–12 Hz) — relaxed focus, meditation  
  - Beta (12–30 Hz) — problem-solving  
  - Gamma (>30 Hz) — integration, binding consciousness  
  ↳ Schumann ~7.83 Hz sits right in the **theta–alpha overlap**.

- **Heart Rhythms**  
  - Resting heart ~1 Hz (60 bpm)  
  - HRV entrains with breath, emotions, geomagnetic activity  
  - Group HRV coherence has measurable environmental effects.  

- **Breath Cycles**  
  - Coherent breathing ~0.1 Hz (6 breaths/min) optimizes HRV.  
  - Bridges voluntary ↔ involuntary systems.

## Human in the Spiral

- **Receives from Earth**:  
  Schumann ↔ brainwaves, geomagnetic activity ↔ HRV.  

- **Feeds Civic**:  
  Group coherence, ritual, and culture emerge from human rhythms.  

- **Feeds Cosmos**:  
  Through intention, creativity, and alignment, humans become **amplifiers** of cosmic patterns.

## Implications

- Human wellness is inseparable from planetary fields.  
- Practices like meditation, drumming, chanting, and breathwork  
  are **entrainment technologies** that stabilize the spiral.  
- Research frontier: **collective coherence feeding back into Earth fields.**
