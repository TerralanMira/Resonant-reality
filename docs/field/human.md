# Human Resonance Layer

The human body is not separate from Earth’s resonance — it is tuned into it.  
Heart rhythms, brain oscillations, breath cycles, and cellular signaling  
all fall within frequency bands shaped by the planet’s electromagnetic envelope.

## Key Anchors

- **Brainwaves**  
  - Delta (0.5–4 Hz) — deep sleep, healing states  
  - Theta (4–8 Hz) — trance, dream, creative flow  
  - Alpha (8–12 Hz) — calm, meditative awareness  
  - Beta (12–30 Hz) — active, problem-solving  
  - Gamma (>30 Hz) — integration, insight, binding consciousness  
  ↳ *Note*: Schumann fundamental (~7.83 Hz) sits right in **Theta–Alpha transition**.

- **Heart Rhythms**  
  - Resting human heartbeat ~1 Hz (60 bpm)  
  - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) entrains with breath, emotional state, and geomagnetic fields.  
  - Research (e.g., HeartMath) shows group coherence can measurably alter local EM environments.

- **Breath Cycles**  
  - Coherent breathing ~0.1 Hz (6 breaths/min) optimizes HRV.  
  - Resonates with **Mayer waves** and slow baroreflex rhythms.  
  - Serves as a bridge between voluntary and involuntary systems.

## Entrainment Windows

- **Earth ↔ Brain**  
  Schumann resonance overlaps with human alpha–theta rhythms.  
  This is why meditation, trance, and dream states feel “attuned.”

- **Earth ↔ Heart**  
  HRV coherence aligns with geomagnetic activity.  
  Storms and calm can be tracked in physiological rhythms.

- **Earth ↔ Collective**  
  Group meditation experiments suggest amplification effects —  
  individual coherence resonates outward.

## Implications

- Human wellness is inseparable from planetary fields.  
- Practices like meditation, chanting, drumming, or coherent breathing  
  can be reframed as **entrainment technologies**.  
- Research direction: Can collective human coherence “feed back” into stabilizing Earth systems?

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/earth.md`** for geophysical resonance.  
- Add case studies of meditation experiments and HRV research.  
- Connect to **simulations**: e.g., model brainwave–Schumann overlap.
