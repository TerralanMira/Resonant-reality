# Human Resonance Layer

The human body is not separate from Earth’s resonance — it is **tuned into it**.  
Heart rhythms, brain oscillations, breath cycles, and cellular signaling  
all fall within frequency bands shaped by the planet’s electromagnetic envelope.

## Core Anchors

- **Brainwaves**  
  - **Delta (0.5–4 Hz)** — deep sleep, cellular repair, unconscious healing  
  - **Theta (4–8 Hz)** — dream, trance, imaginal vision, creativity  
  - **Alpha (8–12 Hz)** — calm presence, meditative awareness, flow  
  - **Beta (12–30 Hz)** — active focus, problem-solving, vigilance  
  - **Gamma (>30 Hz)** — integration, insight, binding consciousness  
  ↳ Note: Schumann fundamental (~7.83 Hz) sits right in the **Theta–Alpha bridge**.

- **Heart Rhythms**  
  - Resting heartbeat ~1 Hz (60 bpm).  
  - **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** entrains with breath, emotion, and geomagnetic fields.  
  - Group heart coherence → local electromagnetic changes (e.g., HeartMath studies).

- **Breath Cycles**  
  - **Coherent breathing ~0.1 Hz (6 breaths/min)** optimizes HRV.  
  - Resonates with **Mayer waves** and autonomic balance.  
  - Serves as a **bridge** between voluntary (mind) and involuntary (body) systems.

- **Cellular Oscillations**  
  - Circadian rhythms (~24h) entrain to solar light/dark cycles.  
  - DNA transcription and repair cycles run in resonance bands.  
  - Suggests body as a **nested oscillator** array.

## Human ↔ Awareness

- Attention reshapes physiology: focused awareness shifts brain rhythm and HRV.  
- Stress/fracture in awareness → incoherence in body rhythms.  
- Ritual, mindfulness, prayer → stabilize human resonance.

---

## Human ↔ Earth

- Brainwaves and HRV align with Schumann bands.  
- Solar storms and geomagnetic fluctuations show measurable impact on mood, sleep, cognition.  
- Human coherence can also **feed back** into local geomagnetic calm.

## Human ↔ Cosmos

- Circadian rhythm entrains to solar day; lunar cycles modulate sleep and fertility.  
- Cosmic radiation and solar flares ripple into biology.  
- Ancient calendars (Mayan, Vedic, Chinese) embedded cosmic cycles into human timekeeping.

## Implications

- Human health is inseparable from planetary and cosmic cycles.  
- Practices like drumming, chanting, yoga, tai chi, and meditation can be reframed as **entrainment technologies**.  
- Research direction: group coherence experiments as stabilizers in times of ecological or social turbulence.

## Next Steps

- Cross-link to **`docs/field/earth.md`** for planetary rhythms.  
- Add data sets: HRV studies, EEG–Schumann overlays.  
- Connect to **simulations**: e.g., brain–earth resonance models, coherence wave propagation.
