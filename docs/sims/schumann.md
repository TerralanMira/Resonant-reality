# Schumann Coupling — Earth’s Global Resonance

This simulation illustrates how the Earth–ionosphere cavity supports  
**standing electromagnetic waves**, with the lowest mode near **7.83 Hz**.  
These are the Schumann resonances — planetary “heartbeat” frequencies.

---

## Concept

- The Earth and ionosphere form a **spherical LC cavity**.  
- Lightning strikes excite this cavity, feeding global-scale oscillations.  
- Human alpha–theta brain rhythms overlap these bands, suggesting possible coupling.  

---

## What It Shows

- The fundamental mode (~7.83 Hz) and higher harmonics.  
- Dependence of frequency on cavity radius (Earth’s size).  
- How coherence across lightning strikes sustains resonances.

## Run It

```bash
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
This produces spectrum and coupling plots saved to:
	•	sims/figures/schumann.png

⸻

Outputs
	•	Spectrum showing the fundamental and first few harmonics.
	•	Example: peaks near 7.8, 14, 20, 26 Hz (approximate).

⸻

Implications
	•	Physics: Earth acts like a resonant cavity, coupling global weather and EM fields.
	•	Biology: Overlap with human brainwave bands suggests windows for entrainment.
	•	Civic: Global coherence practices (e.g., synchronized meditation) may interact with these bands.

Next Steps
	•	Cross-link to docs/field/human.md (alpha–theta overlap).
	•	Compare model frequencies with real data in docs/earth/data.md.
	•	Add figure (sims/figures/schumann.png) to the gallery in docs/sims/index.md.
