# Schumann Coupling

This model explores how oscillators couple through the Earth–ionosphere cavity.  
Near 7.83 Hz (the Schumann fundamental), local nodes can entrain to global rhythms.

## How to run
```bash
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
What to look for
	•	Strongest coherence near ~7.83 Hz.
	•	Phase sync emerges in entrainment window.
	•	Falsifier: flat coupling across frequencies.
