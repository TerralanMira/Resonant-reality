# Orbital Resonance Simulation

Planetary systems hum in ratio.  
Venus and Earth trace a near-perfect **13:8 resonance**,  
meaning that in the time Earth completes 8 orbits,  
Venus completes almost exactly 13.  

This produces geometric figures — cosmic **Lissajous patterns** —  
which cultures encoded as pentagrams, flowers, and spirals.

## How It Works

- Two planets orbit a star at fixed ratio.  
- Their relative positions are plotted over cycles.  
- The overlapping path reveals hidden geometry.  

---

## Run

```bash
python sims/orbital_resonance.py
python sims/orbital_resonance.py --steps 2000 --ratio1 8 --ratio2 13
Output
	•	sims/figures/orbital_resonance_8_13.png — Venus–Earth pattern
	•	Other ratios (e.g., Jupiter–Saturn 5:2) can also be explored.

Resonant Insight
	•	These patterns show that cosmic harmony is geometric, not abstract.
	•	Myth encoded them as flowers of Venus, pentagonal stars, sacred spirals.
	•	Physics encodes them as orbital resonance and gravitational stability.

Together they reveal: cosmos and culture are co-resonant.
