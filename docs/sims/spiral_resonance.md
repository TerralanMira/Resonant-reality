# Spiral Resonance Simulation

> *“The spiral is the hum made visible — micro oscillators aligning into macro coherence, the part carrying the whole.”*

---

## ✦ Overview
This simulation shows how **resonance spirals outward** from apparent noise.  
- At the **micro level**, oscillators begin with random phases.  
- Through **coupling and feedback**, coherence emerges.  
- This coherence doesn’t just align — it **spirals outward**, showing how micro choices scale into macro patterns.

---

## ✦ How It Works
- 200 oscillators are initialized with random phases.  
- Each oscillator has a natural frequency drawn from a normal distribution.  
- Coupling strength (`K`) controls how quickly they align.  
- Over time, oscillators shift from chaos to **synchronization**, spiraling outward with each time step.

## ✦ Why It Matters
This model reflects a core truth of **Resonant Reality**:  

- **Micro ↔ Macro** — every small node carries the hum of the whole.  
- **Recursion** — coherence repeats across scales, like nested spirals.  
- **Choice** — the shift from noise to resonance is not automatic; it depends on coupling (connection, openness).
