# Civic Coherence Grid — LC Modes (Plaza Analogue)

A toy **grid of coupled LC oscillators** (or mass-spring) to show how **geometry shapes modes**.  
Think plaza layouts / hearth constellations as **resonant fields**.

## What it shows
- Different layouts → different mode spectra / hotspots.
- Edges and hubs focus energy (designable coherence).

## How to run
```bash
python sims/civic_coherence_grid.py
Output: sims/figures/civic_grid_modes.png (mode intensities heatmap)

Pass / Falsifier
	•	Pass: distinct spatial patterns by topology/params.
	•	Falsifier: no spatial differentiation across layouts.

Next
	•	Import real plaza maps.
	•	Couple to crowd rhythm inputs.
	•	Link to: docs/civic/plazas.md, docs/civic/hearths.md.
