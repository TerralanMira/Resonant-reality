# Meta-Resonance — Coupling Coherence Across Layers

Toy model that **couples two subsystems** (e.g., Ritual coherence R₁ and Economy price stability R₂)  
to explore **feedback windows**: when does improving one aid or harm the other?

## What it shows
- **Co-benefit band**: both layers rise together.
- **Tug-of-war band**: one rises while the other drops (overcoupling).
- **Design window**: coupling values that sustain both.

## How to run
```bash
python sims/meta_resonance.py
Output: sims/figures/meta_resonance.png (R₁, R₂ vs coupling γ)

Next
	•	Plug in real outputs from other sims.
	•	Map civic policy levers to coupling γ.
