# LC Grid Modes

This simulation shows how LC circuits arranged in a lattice resonate collectively.  
Geometry determines spectra: square, hexagonal, and triangular grids support distinct mode structures.

## How to run
```bash
python sims/lc_grid.py
What to look for
	•	Frequency peaks shift with geometry.
	•	Higher coupling sharpens collective modes.
	•	Falsifier: no dependence on grid topology.
