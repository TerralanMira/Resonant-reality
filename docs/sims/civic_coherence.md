# Civic Coherence Simulations

Civic resonance can be explored with minimal models that show how  
bodies, voices, clocks, and media synchronize or fragment.

## 1. Plazas as Oscillator Couplers
Model a **crowd in a square** with Kuramoto dynamics.  
- Each individual = oscillator with its own rhythm (chant, clap, step).  
- The plaza = coupling medium (sound reflections, proximity).  
- Output: order parameter R showing when the crowd locks into unified rhythm.  
- Application: why chants become powerful when enough voices join.

## 2. Calendar Drift & Reset
Model **calendar coherence**.  
- Agents = communities with different festival cycles.  
- Noise = seasonal drift, errors in counting.  
- Reset = leap day, equinox ceremony.  
- Output: measure of phase alignment across communities.  
- Application: why rituals like New Year or solstice renew coherence.

## 3. Law as Phase Constraint
Model **law/charter** as a field that constrains oscillators.  
- Without law: oscillators drift, high disorder.  
- With law: some frequencies are “snapped” to common values.  
- Output: compare coherence under weak vs strong legal constraints.  
- Application: shows law as a “resonance stabilizer” but also potential for rigidity.

## 4. Media as Global Coupler
Model **media broadcasts**.  
- Broadcast = a global periodic signal.  
- Oscillators = individuals; some entrain, others resist.  
- Output: coherence vs fragmentation depending on trust/noise.  
- Application: shows media’s dual role as harmonizer or polarizer.

## Next Steps
- Add Python stubs in `sims/` for each scenario.  
- Link visuals: spiral of a plaza, phase histograms for calendars, coherence vs rigidity plots for law, entrainment curves for media.  
- Cross-link to **docs/field/civic/index.md** and **docs/field/human.md** for narrative context.
