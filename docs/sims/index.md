# Simulations — myth → math → visible coherence

These models are not just “physics toys.”  
Each is a lens into resonance across scales — from oscillators to societies.  
They show how the same hum that locks fireflies in sync  
also tunes human hearts, Earth’s ionosphere, and even our economies.

To run them is to *see coherence emerge*.  
To read them is to glimpse the **fractal rhyme** of myth and math:  
micro spirals mirroring macro fields, signals binding into wholeness.

## Index
- [Spiral Resonance](spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated)
- [Kuramoto Sync](kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises
- [LC Grid Modes](lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra
- [Schumann Coupling](schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz
- [Resonant Currency](resonant_currency.md) — policy as conductor; coherence as value
