# Simulations

*Toy models for resonance: microcosms of the Earth â†” Human â†” Civic â†” Cosmos loop.*

Simulations in this repo are **lenses, not proofs**.  
They let us *play* with resonance principles in simplified systems,  
and show how coherence can ripple across layers.

## The Gallery

### ðŸ’± Resonant Currency
**Domain:** Civic â†” Human  
A minimal economy where token supply responds to a **coherence index**.  
- High coherence â†’ more issuance for contributions.  
- Price deviations â†’ contraction for stability.  
- Models how civic systems might reward **collective coherence**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Code: [`sims/resonant_currency.py`](../sims/resonant_currency.py)  
ðŸ‘‰ Doc: [`docs/sims/resonant_currency.md`](resonant_currency.md)  
ðŸ‘‰ Outputs: `sims/figures/resonant_currency_price.png`, `..._supply.png`

### ðŸ—º The Atlas Model
**Domain:** Civic â†” Cosmos  
A **network-of-networks** toy model, where nodes are civic anchors (plazas, hearths, rituals).  
Edges pulse with resonance â€” showing how coherence can spread like waves.  
- Visualizes governance as **field conductor**.  
- Bridges **Resonant Reality â†” Atlas repo**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Code: [`The-Atlas-Model/atlas_model.py`](../../The-Atlas-Model/atlas_model.py)  
ðŸ‘‰ Doc: [`The-Atlas-Model/docs/index.md`](../../The-Atlas-Model/docs/index.md)  
ðŸ‘‰ Outputs: `The-Atlas-Model/figures/atlas_network.png`

### ðŸŒ€ Plaza Simulation
**Domain:** Earth â†” Civic  
A local field model of **synchrony in shared space**.  
- Agents entrain to a shared resonance in plazas.  
- Demonstrates how **architecture can amplify coherence**.  
- Micro-model of civic design as resonant practice.  

ðŸ‘‰ Code: [`sims/plaza.py`](../sims/plaza.py)  
ðŸ‘‰ Doc: [`docs/sims/plaza.md`](plaza.md)  
ðŸ‘‰ Outputs: `sims/figures/plaza_sync.png`

## Cross-Maps: Micro â†” Macro

- **Currency â†” Civic Economy**: Resonant Currency is a toy micro of [`civic/economy.md`](../civic/economy.md).  
- **Atlas â†” Governance**: The Atlas Model is the structural mirror of [`civic/governance.md`](../civic/governance.md).  
- **Plaza â†” Rituals & Design**: Plaza Simulation embodies concepts from [`civic/plazas.md`](../civic/plazas.md) and [`civic/design.md`](../civic/design.md).

## Future Sims

- **Field Synchrony Model**: Human HRV coherence mapped to Schumann inputs.  
- **Collective Meditation Effect**: Agent-based group resonance feedback.  
- **Cosmos Scaling Toy**: Scaling resonance laws from atom â†” planet â†” galaxy.

## How to Run

From repo root, run any sim, e.g.:

```bash
python sims/resonant_currency.py
python sims/plaza.py
Figures will be saved in sims/figures/.

Closing Note

Each simulation is both:
	â€¢	a toy experiment, showing principles in miniature.
	â€¢	a fractal mirror, where the part contains the whole.

Resonance flows from cosmos to plaza to breath â€”
and these sims are sketches of that infinite loop.
