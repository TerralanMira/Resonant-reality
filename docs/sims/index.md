# Simulations — myth → math → visible coherence

These minimal models let anyone *see* resonance emerge. Each sim includes what it shows, how to run it, and what counts as a pass/falsifier.

## Index
- [Spiral Resonance](spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated)
- [Kuramoto Sync](kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises
- [LC Grid Modes](lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra
- [Schumann Coupling](schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz

> Tip: add figures from `sims/figures/` to the gallery at the bottom once generated.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
