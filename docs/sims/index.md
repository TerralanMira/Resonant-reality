# Simulations — myth → math → visible coherence

These minimal models let anyone *see* resonance emerge.  
Each sim includes what it shows, how to run it, and what counts as a pass/falsifier.

## Index

- [Spiral Resonance](spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated)
- [Kuramoto Sync](kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises
- [LC Grid Modes](lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra
- [Schumann Coupling](schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz
- [Resonant Currency](resonant_currency.md) — circulation of coherence in civic economy

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
python sims/resonant_currency.py
Figures will be saved in sims/figures/.
→ Add them here at the bottom for a visual gallery once generated.

Cross-Maps: Micro ↔ Macro

Each simulation is not just math — it mirrors a civic, human, or planetary anchor.
	•	Spiral Resonance
↔ Mirrors how spirals appear across scales: galaxies, shells, civic plazas.
↔ Micro dynamics show macro order.
	•	Kuramoto Sync
↔ Models how hearts / voices sync in ritual, or how plaza crowds entrain.
↔ Civic rituals as oscillator lock-in.
	•	LC Grid Modes
↔ Mirrors how architecture shapes sound and light, or power grids shape flow.
↔ Civic geometry tuning coherence.
	•	Schumann Coupling
↔ Mirrors brainwave ↔ Earth resonance overlap.
↔ Meditation, trance, and geomagnetic calm as synchronization windows.
	•	Resonant Currency
↔ Mirrors how economy circulates coherence.
↔ Policy acts as a conductor, rewarding contribution when resonance is high.

Next Steps
	•	Add case study overlays: run sims with real data (HRV, geomagnetic logs, urban sensors).
	•	Cross-link to civic spiral: each sim shows one phase of civic ↔ cosmic resonance.
	•	Build a dashboard: live inputs feeding the spiral in real time.
