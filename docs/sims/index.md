# Simulations — myth → math → visible coherence

These models are not just “physics toys.”  
Each is a lens into resonance across scales — from oscillators to societies.  
They show how the same hum that locks fireflies in sync  
also tunes human hearts, Earth’s ionosphere, and even our economies.

> **Note:** Simulations are optional. This site publishes without running Python.
> Figures are placeholders until someone runs them on a laptop and adds images to `sims/figures/`.
> The concepts and civic applications stand on their own.
To run them is to *see coherence emerge*.  
To read them is to glimpse the **fractal rhyme** of myth and math:  
micro spirals mirroring macro fields, signals binding into wholeness.

## Index
- [Spiral Resonance](spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated)
- [Kuramoto Sync](kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises
- [LC Grid Modes](lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra
- [Schumann Coupling](schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz
- [Resonant Currency](resonant_currency.md) — policy as conductor; coherence as value

Figures will be saved in `sims/figures/`  
→ Add them here at the bottom for a visual gallery once generated.

## 🔗 Cross-Maps — Each Simulation as Micro of Macro

- **Spiral Resonance** → mirrors **cosmos** (galaxies, vortices) and **civic plazas**.  
- **Kuramoto Sync** → mirrors **human brain/heart sync** and **civic governance assemblies**.  
- **LC Grid Modes** → mirrors **field geometries** and **civic architecture**.  
- **Schumann Coupling** → mirrors **Earth–human entrainment** and **collective ritual timing**.  
- **Resonant Currency** → mirrors **economy as conductor**, balancing coherence with flow.

> Each minimal model is a **toy proof**:  
> part showing the whole, whole shaping the part.
