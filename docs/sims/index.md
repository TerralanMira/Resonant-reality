# Simulations — myth → math → visible coherence

These minimal models let anyone *see* resonance emerge.  
Each sim includes what it shows, how to run it, and what counts as a pass/falsifier.  
Think of them as “portals” where the invisible becomes visible.

## Index
- [Spiral Resonance](spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated)
- [Kuramoto Sync](kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises
- [LC Grid Modes](lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra
- [Schumann Coupling](schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz
### Civic Sims
- [Plaza Synchrony](civic_coherence.md) — crowd lock-in (Kuramoto)

- Law Constraint — `python sims/law_constraint.py`
- Media Coupler — `python sims/media_coupler.py`
- - [Reciprocity Network](reciprocity_network.md) — economy as balanced give/receive flows

## Quickstart

Install requirements, then run any sim:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python sims/spiral_resonance.py
python sims/kuramoto_basic.py
python sims/lc_grid.py
python sims/schumann_coupling.py
Figures will be saved in `sims/figures/`  
→ Add them here at the bottom for a visual gallery once generated.
