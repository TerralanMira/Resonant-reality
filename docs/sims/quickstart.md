# Simulations Quickstart

> *Myth → math → visible coherence.*

This page is for those who want the **fastest path from code → figure**.  
Each simulation shows resonance becoming visible in a different way.

## ✦ Index
- [Spiral Resonance](spiral_resonance.md) — micro → macro spiral of coherence (animated).  
- [Kuramoto Sync](kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises.  
- [LC Grid Modes](lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra.  
- [Schumann Coupling](schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz.
