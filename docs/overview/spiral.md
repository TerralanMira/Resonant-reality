# Spiral Geometry — Archetype of Coherence

The spiral is the universal pattern of resonance.  
It bridges the micro and the macro, the living and the cosmic.

## Expressions of the Spiral

- **Nature** — shells, hurricanes, galaxies  
- **Body** — breath cycle, heartbeat variability, brainwave phases  
- **Culture** — labyrinth paths, dance spirals, civic plazas  
- **Cosmos** — golden ratio and wave interference

## Why Spiral?

- **Resonance Path**: Energy does not move in straight lines — it coils and distributes.  
- **Self-Similarity**: Spirals repeat across scales, binding fractals into coherence.  
- **Memory Structure**: A spiral is not a closed circle but an open return — it carries forward while returning.

## Simulations Connection

- [Spiral Resonance Simulation](../sims/spiral_resonance.md) shows how phase patterns spiral outward.  
- Visual coherence is the first “hello” of resonance.

## Mythic Echoes

- The **cosmic egg cracks into a spiral universe**.  
- Ancient dances (Greek *geranos*, Sufi whirling) embody spiral paths of return.  
- The spiral is a memory keeper — you come back, but never the same.

## Next Steps

- Add figures: natural spirals (nautilus, galaxies).  
- Embed GIF of spiral sim once generated.  
- Cross-link to civic design (spiral plazas).
