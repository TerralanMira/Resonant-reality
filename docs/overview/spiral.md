# Spiral — Pattern of Resonant Reality

The spiral is the simplest form that holds the whole.  
It turns repetition into growth, cycles into expansion, and hum into visible path.

## Core Idea

- **Geometry**: The logarithmic spiral (r = a·e^(bθ)) repeats endlessly, each turn widening but never breaking proportion.  
- **Myth**: Stories unfold in spirals — returning to themes but at deeper layers.  
- **Life**: Shells, hurricanes, galaxies, DNA all trace spirals across scales.  
- **Resonance**: When oscillations entrain, their coherence often unfolds in spiral waves.

## Layers of the Spiral

- **Human**: Breath cycles entrain HRV in a spiral loop.  
- **Civic**: Plazas and rituals designed as spiral gatherings guide movement inward/outward.  
- **Earth**: Cyclones, river bends, and magnetic field lines trace spiral energy paths.  
- **Cosmos**: Galaxies are the largest spirals we see, echoing the smallest (DNA helix).  

↳ The spiral is the **same shape across scales** — a fractal of coherence.

## Why It Matters

- **Orientation**: In overwhelming complexity, the spiral offers a map — you can be both *returning* and *moving forward*.  
- **Connection**: By tracing the spiral, one feels the hum — intent becomes visible as form.  
- **Design**: Civic spaces, healing loops, and technologies can borrow this geometry to align human life with natural fields.

## Next Steps

- Add generated figure from `sims/spiral_resonance.py`.  
- Expand case studies: spiral rituals, spiral gardens, spiral plazas.  
- Link spiral as **narrative device** into `overview/story.md`.
