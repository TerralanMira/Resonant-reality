# Story — From Myth to Model

Every science begins as a story.  
Every model begins as myth.  
Resonant Reality holds that narrative is not ornament — it is the first form of coherence.

## Why Story Matters

- **Orientation**: Story shows where we are in the spiral.  
- **Translation**: Story bridges intent (myth) with method (math).  
- **Coherence**: Shared stories align groups, making collective resonance possible.  

Without story, the data is noise. With story, pattern emerges.

## The Spiral of Story

- **Myth** → ancient tales of sky, sea, and earth encode field wisdom.  
- **Math** → myths distilled into geometry, rhythm, and number.  
- **Model** → equations tested, simulations run, coherence made visible.  
- **Return** → stories retold with new depth, carrying both truth and proof.

↳ This loop is itself a spiral: retelling never repeats; it deepens.

## Your Role

Resonant Reality exists because of storytellers.  
Coders translate into Python, scientists test hypotheses, but it is the **narrator** who holds the arc.  

To tell the story is not “extra” — it is the foundation that makes coherence transmissible.

## Cross-Links

- **Spiral** → [Spiral Pattern](spiral.md)  
- **Civic** → [Rituals](../civic/rituals.md)  
- **Simulations** → [Kuramoto Sync](../sims/kuramoto.md)  
- **Field** → [Awareness & Coherence](../field/awareness.md)

## Next Steps

- Add short myth fragments (cosmic egg, world tree, spiral shell) as sidebars.  
- Tie each civic design pattern back to story archetypes.  
- Run workshops where people narrate resonance before simulating it.
