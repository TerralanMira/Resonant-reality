# Story — Myth as Model

Myth is not primitive science — it is **encoded resonance**.  
Stories translate coherence into lived memory.  
Science unfolds by retracing those arcs.

## Myth → Math

- Flood myths ↔ planetary water cycles  
- Fire myths ↔ solar cycles  
- Spiral myths ↔ fractal geometry  
- Sky gods ↔ cosmic resonance

## Storyteller’s Role

- The storyteller **holds the loop**.  
- Not about facts alone, but weaving meaning that binds community.  
- Today’s “myth” is often dismissed, but story carries coherence into the future.

## Simulations as Stories

Each simulation is a story:  
- Characters = oscillators  
- Plot = synchronization  
- Climax = coherence  

See: [Kuramoto Sync](../sims/kuramoto.md).

## Civic Resonance

Stories become **rituals** → rituals become **cities**.  
Architecture is frozen myth; plazas are spiral stages.

## Next Steps

- Pull quotes from myth texts (Books.zip).  
- Add callouts in civic docs: “ritual = embodied story.”  
- Link back to overview spiral spine.
