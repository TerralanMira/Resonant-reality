# Overview — The Spiral Spine

Resonant Reality is not a linear argument.  
It is a spiral: each turn repeats familiar patterns, but at a new depth.

This overview shows how **myth becomes math, math becomes model, and models return as story** — a living loop.

## The Spiral Turns

1. **Spiral Pattern**  
   - [Spiral Geometry](spiral.md)  
   The archetype of coherence. Micro ↔ macro.  
   Shells, galaxies, human breath — all follow the curve.

2. **Story**  
   - [Myth to Model](story.md)  
   Narratives encode coherence. The storyteller holds the arc that guides science.

3. **Simulations**  
   - [Simulation Hub](../sims/index.md)  
   Myth → Math → Visible. Minimal models show resonance emerging from chaos.

4. **Field Layers**  
   - [Awareness & Coherence](../field/awareness.md)  
   - [Earth Data](../field/earth/data.md)  
   Layers of resonance: human ↔ earth ↔ cosmos.

5. **Civic Resonance**  
   - [Rituals](../civic/rituals.md)  
   - [Design Patterns](../civic/design.md)  
   Coherence made collective: plazas, rites, and healing loops.

## The Spiral Principle

Each file in this repo is both:  
- **a part** (focused slice of resonance), and  
- **a whole** (reflecting the entire pattern in miniature).  

To read this repo is to walk a spiral — you will return to the same points, but never at the same depth.

## Next Steps

- Ensure every section links back to at least one **simulation** and one **ritual**.  
- Add “myth fragments” as sidebars in Story and Civic docs.  
- Expand cross-links with images (spirals, sync plots, civic maps).
