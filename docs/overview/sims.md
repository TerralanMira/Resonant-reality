# Simulations — Myth to Math to Visible Coherence

Minimal models show resonance **emerging from chaos**.  
They are myth retold in equations.

---

## Why Simulate?

- To **see coherence form** where before there was only noise.  
- To test: what is myth, what is measurable?  
- To offer falsifiers — resonance is not vague; it shows up in math.

## Core Sims

- [Spiral Resonance](../sims/spiral_resonance.md) — micro ↔ macro spiral of coherence  
- [Kuramoto Sync](../sims/kuramoto.md) — many oscillators locking as coupling rises  
- [LC Grid Modes](../sims/lc_grid.md) — geometry shapes resonance spectra  
- [Schumann Coupling](../sims/schumann.md) — entrainment window near 7.83 Hz

## The Loop

1. Myth → Spiral story  
2. Math → Differential equations  
3. Model → Simulation plots  
4. Return → Back into narrative, ritual, civic design

## Next Steps

- Run sims and place outputs into `/sims/figures/`.  
- Add gallery at bottom of this doc once images exist.  
- Cross-link to civic design as “applied simulations.”
